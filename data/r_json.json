        "reviewText": "So as you may have guessed, I like this system. I like it so much I looked around the internet to find and explain this system to other people. I own three Matrix drills (2 Old and 1 New) and use them for all my projects. TL;DR This thing rocks.September 2014 (Old Matrix): I don't have much storage space, but I needed to get some power tools for a ton of projects. I was going to get one of those beginner power tool sets that many brands sell: four big tools and one battery for $200. As I was comparing these sets in-store I noticed the (Old) Matrix and a couple of accessories that were near by. I love multifunctional items, this system was (at the time) seven tools in one for about $250, and could be stored in a bag anywhere!I ended up being very lucky as many sales and discounts came my way. At one point I ended up just buying another drill for its battery because it was the same price as an individually sold battery. Because of how many projects I ended up doing I also bought two 4.0 Amp hour batteries and a Quick Charge Station. (20-45 min for a drained 1.5 amp, 1-2 hour for a drained 4.0 amp [temperature plays a role]) Later on I found the second drill essential as it would be switched to while the first drill cooled off.2014 (Old):This \"power unit\" brought me back into my workshop, a yard (as the only open enough space), and helped me finish a desk, shelf, table, deck, and shed. Each accessory had a part to play and took me through projects quickly, I could carry two attachments with me with one on the unit and switched between them in seconds to move quickly and efficiently. I recommend the 4.0 Amp Hour battery as it pushes the motor through possible bog down situations. It may seem odd but it can be felt just how differently the motor reacts to resistance with different batteries. By the way, the sparks in the motor are normal as this is a brushed motor, but smoke and fire are not.My most used and favorite is a tie between the Circular Saw and the Impact Driver though the Sander and Jigsaw are close behind. The Routing attachment and Oscillating Tool have been interesting and fun to use but are niche as intended. The battery hogs are the Sander and Oscillator though the Saw can kill a battery quickly (constant use: 1.5 amp 10-20 min, 4.0 amp 1-2 hour). The drill/driver is what it is. The Circular Saw has some quirks, I don't use the \"guide line\" and shouldn't be used to cut more than 3/4\" thick wood, what it can cut through solely depends on the blade and how sharp it is. The Impact Driver is a beast and with a 4.0 Amp battery can sometimes remove lug nuts. The Sander is fantastic for sanding, who'da thought. The Jigsaw is only as good as its blades. The Router is awkward but works (see questions answered). The Oscillation Tool can bog down but is awesome as a scraper/paint/rust remover as it is harsher than the sander. The Inflation attachment works and can inflate balls and tires but has a \"might burn you because it gets so hot\" negative. The Reciprocating Saw attachment is alright but I haven't given it much testing.2015 (New Matrix): Why put this all in a review of the new Matrix? Because the old one is no longer manufactured and I own the new one. \"There are a couple differences between the drills. The new design adds more vents for the motor addressing a, \"very extreme use,\" overheating problem present in the old model. The bit that comes with the drill has been moved to the top in order to put an L.E.D. light on the base facing towards the front, lighting the work area, a commonly requested feature. Also the color scheme has changed to look more like their new branding.\"Let me put some more detail into this. The previous model had 4 vents: one big one on the left and right side, and two on the back. Even in the cooler weather of the fall it sometimes became too hot to hold and I had to let it sit for a few minutes. The new model has 13 vents: four on top, one even bigger one (than the old) on the left and right side, 4 on the bottom of the motor housing, two on the back, and one on top of the control unit heat sink in the handle. This new unit breathes. I can't get it to overheat in humid 80 degree fahrenheit weather. Because of this, an unusual problem arises: the attachments themselves overheat. They become to hot to hold and I suspect the grease inside isn't quite meant for this much use. It may have been changed in newer attachments, keep in mind my attachments are from the older production even if they are the same design.A subtle but huge improvement is the trigger, the range and sensitivity of the trigger put it up with Dewalt, not necessarily in durability but in trigger quality. A smooth pull is great for more delicate projects when using these attachments. If you are handy and feel like VOIDING your warranty, you can open up the drill as the screws are easier to access compared to the older model. Watch out for the selector spring, attachment detector spring (a plastic nub that is pushed in when an attachment is... attached, and prevents the motor from activating without an attachment on the unit), and springy attachment holding ring. If these are not placed in the exact correct positions the unit may not function properly.The light is useful but isn't as good as the idealized light featured in the promotional photos. It's better than similar drills at its price point but is obviously out shined by more expensive products. And while we're on ok stuff: the rubberization on the drill is ok but is grabby in an inconvenient way at times. The selector is a bit stiff and may just need to be \"broken in\" but it feels as if it has been moved from the original position.In my opinion the original design has one advantage over the new design: the grip. In an effort to dissipate heat and eliminate areas that could collect heat they chose to taper the upper part of the grip into the back of the drill. This improved heat dissipation but works against your own grip. When leaning into the handle the wrist rolls forward which is uncomfortable and takes some strength out of the arm, where as before the bulk/more rectangular back end served as a stop along the top of the wrist.2014 (Old): Opening the power unit will likely void your warranty. Watch out for the selector spring, attachment detector spring (a plastic nub that is pushed in when an attachment is... attached, and prevents the motor from activating without an attachment on the unit), and springy attachment holding ring. If these are not placed in the exact correct positions the unit may not function properly. Its nice to get a good look at what is going on in there how ever and shows a few key things. The motor is \"closed\" = when the brushes on the motor are gone they cannot be replaced and a new motor or more likely new unit must be bought. The wiring job is a little off and will likely succumb to \"wire fatigue\" because of their placement and inadequate soldering at connections. Keeping in mind that these issues only present after two or three years, this is all acceptable and more than enough for the price.I really like this \"unit.\" It has been absolutely fantastic and has outperformed my expectations. I'll update if anything changes or if I feel like voiding the warranty for the sake of photos.",

It is extremely light, durable, with a good grip. The light illuminates dark areas nicely however the magnetic bit holder is nothing to brag about. The bit falls off when using some attachments that cause intense vibrations. Easy and simple to change attachments from a large selection.

        "reviewText": "Yep. It's a drill. Drills and drives into a variety of materials.A bit of background - I'm an artist and make large constructions as part of an installation group. This is important for you to know because it means that I routinely abuse tools in ways which they were not originally intended, and use them to put together materials that have no business being together. Somehow, nothing's fallen on anyone yet, even when it's a pivoting screen wall ten feet tall.Now that I almost have the appearance of legitimacy, I'll tell you about my experiences with this drill.It's pretty handy, actually, since it's so lightweight - it's much easier to stand on a ladder with this little guy over my head all day than a heavy-duty Hilti or something like that. Despite being a little two-speeder, I've been drilling holes in steel stock and various woods all day long with it, and it doesn't complain. Battery lasts most of the day, too, even the little mini one they ship (I got two with my refurb). Haven't needed it for masonry yet, but I'm sure I can anchor in some stuff with it if I need to.My biggest complaints are that the little LED light on it only lights up when you're actually drilling, which makes it pretty much useless if you're lining things up in the dark (not that I do). Also, with the little battery, you can't balance it upright. I never thought I'd miss that but I do, it's a little awkward to put down compared to other stuff.But overall, if you're not building a house with it, it'll serve you well. It's a good household drill, or supplement to a contractor's kit.",

I drill a lot of holes in concrete and cinderblock and it does pretty well for a small drill. The reason it only gets 3 stars is the chuck. It does not hold well and I have to constantly re-tighten whatever bit I am using. I know the vibration of using it as a hammer drill contributes to this problem but I think it's possible to design/manufacture a chuck that performs better than this one. I would gladly pay a little more for a better chuck.",

After a few weeks of occasional use the battery is still on 3 out of 3 charge - it's great to just pick it up and use it, without charging or plugging in a plug. The small size tips great for getting into tight corners - for a regular home without major works, that seems more important than having brute power. I haven't really tested the power, but it has drilled into every material I've tried it on, with no problem at all. I highly recommend this drill for the regular domestic user (probably a bit lightweight for more industrial types) - very convenient, light to hold, good battery.",

On the one hand, you can be like \"it's an electric screwdriver, you can screw things, only faster.\" But on the other hand, you can screw things a LOT faster, without hurting your wrist. And getting to precisely dial in how many pounds of torque you're giving to the screws means NEVER overtightening. I find ways to use this nearly every day. Even as a rudimentary drill for drilling taps to drive screws into. The batteries so far seem to be very reliable and last for a very long time, and having two means even if I'm really going crazy screwing means by the time one battery runs out, the other one will always be recharged and ready to go. I was able to remove and rehang a screen door with this in minutes. I've used it to hang heavy mirrors and assemble furniture, and I even got a hex-chuck socket adaptor so I can use it as an extremely fast socket wrench as well. I really don't know how I lived without it.",

Much more powerful than my old one as far as the motor goes.  That said, it has TERRIBLE battery life.  My old 18v Dewalt could go and go and go and go between charges.  This thing can't do much more than drive maybe 25 screws before it starts slowing down.  Nice drill but keep your charger going constantly and close by!!",

I do find the ergonomics to be great, but I'd like a larger grip.  I love the way the chuck tightens - very secure bite and all of my bits spin true with none of the bit wobble a few other reviewers have reported.One thing to note is that she will occasionally throw a spark or two as the clutch engages upon trigger release.  This is typical of high powered plug-ins, so be aware of your environment.  This isn't something to use around gas lines, for example.Battery life is exceptional and recharging is quick.This is a professional level tool that will withstand the rigors of daily abuse, as noted by other reviewers who depend on these things to put bread on their tables.  I'm glad I purchased this.",

The drill so far is doing great, used it on a deck project and it has plenty of power and the battery recharge is really quick even though the batteries last a good while. I have been a big fan of Dewalt for a while, but I can't understand why they put a light on the drill that doesn't shine on your work (chuck is in the way and leaves a shadow) and the bit clip (you have to buy extra) is almost impossible to use due to its tightness. These bells and whistles are not important to me so I give the drill 5 stars.",

So I'm guessing it sat around for 2 years. It has no battery indicator lights to tell you how much charge is left. However, it does have an led light which is an upgrade from the older versions. You really have to watch buying cordless tools with NiCad batteries because they are a being phased out. The price really needs to come down on this old technology. The 20v lithium models are outstanding, but for $99 it's worth a try. The drill is comparable to other 18v brands.",

Remember to fully charge overnight the first time you open it.Once you begin to recharge, be nice to your battery and don't just leave it on a charge when it's already charged.This would cut the life of the battery in half (not just this battery, but all batteries) Don't overcharge except for the first time.And don't let it sit without use. If have to, every 3-4 months try to exhaust the battery and recharge as usual.Reverse works well, torque act appropriately. I tried to find something cheezy or loose, or dicey but couldn't.

I figured if it's not going to last long, I'm not paying out the a** for it. This has a 2 year warrant and the Crafstman I looked at has a 1 year warranty so that's what sold me.I love the powerful 20 volts. The battery charge lasts a long time.

I also use the drill function every once in a while, and it works very well at this, too. The battery lasts for a few hours when new, longer than it takes to charge a dead one. If you buy two batteries, you should be able to work non-stop. This drill works at full capacity until the battery gives up, then it dies almost instantly. There is no slowing down to give you any warning, only the charge indicator lights if you remember to look at them.

        "reviewText": "I have this drill and it's very good. I'm rating it 4 stars rather than 5 only based on value relative to the Milwaukee Fuel drills. Rather than buying this drill, I strongly suggest you buy the Fuel version. I bought this drill despite somebody at a big hardware store chain trying to convince me to get the Fuel. He was right. I now own the Fuel hammer drill as well. If I'd bought that drill to start with I would have save myself $100.This drill is light and powerful. It's well balanced and feels excellent to use. I considered the 18V drills until I held them. Far too heavy and bulky for my needs. If you're in construction and driving 3\" screws through wood all day maybe it makes sense to get a n 18V drill. For everything else the 12V seems more than adequate.This week I needed a hammer drill to put some anchors in concrete. I looked around at all the options, and it came down to a corded hammer drill or a smaller cordless. Since I already have the 12V system, the choice to get the Fuel drill was obvious. So now I have this drill and the 2404 (Fuel hammer drill). I should have just bought the 2404 to begin with.I recommend you consider the Fuel rather than this drill for several reasons:1. It comes with two batteries (large and small), both of which have more capacity than the batteries that come with this drill. I say it again: the small battery that comes with the Fuel has more capacity that this batteries that come with this one.2. You get the larger battery with the Fuel. It has far more capacity and gives the tools more power. Not sure how/why this is, but it does. If you're even possibly considering other 12V Milwaukee tools, you're going to want the bigger battery. The larger battery also allows the drill to stand on the handle, which is nice sometimes.3. This Fuel drills have more power and are more efficient. So you get more battery life. And because the motors are brushless they should last longer. The Fuel drill I have (2404) also has a larger, more robust chuck. It's just a better drill all the way around. And it doesn't get nearly as hot under heavy load.4. I wanted to upgrade to the large capacity battery anyway. If I had bought the Fuel drill to being with I'd already have two batteries with more capacity. The Fuel drill is worth the extra cost just to get the better batteries. It's like getting the better drill for free.As good as this drill is, the Fuel is better. If you're going to get the fuel drill I recommend the 2404, which has a hammer drill function. The 2403 is similar but doesn't have a hammer drill feature. When I bought this drill I said \"I'll never want more power and I'll absolutely never need a hammer drill.\" I was wrong on both accounts.I like this drill, but it's now largely superfluous since I have the Fuel drill as well. If you are considering this drill do yourself a favor and spend a little more for one of the Fuel drills.",

So I went to the authorized Hitachi dealer who said \"these are discontinued\" Where did you get them. I said Amazon. He said they have been discontinued for a long time. He ordered two batteries. they came in-package covered with dust. Neither one worked.  The batteries are no longer available. BEWARE",

I bought this through an Amazon trading partner and mistakenly came to believe (from copy on their site) that the drill has a built-in LED light. That's so useful in the basement or outdoors on a project that is still in progress after sundown. It does not have a light. For me, that was a deal-breaker and I wound up returning the Hitachi drill. I since bought a Milwaukee multi-tool 18-volt set including a Sawzall (every man should own one, and sooner or later he'll figure out something that needs to be cut up) but these items, the drill especially, are markedly heavier: 3.4 pounds with battery for the Hitachi for the 3/8-inch drill, 5.0 pounds for the Milwaukee 1/2-inch drill. Unless you're a construction pro, you might come to value lighter weight.",

        "reviewText": "I'm not a professional, I just need tools for working around the house, and I really like the idea of cordless products.  I wanted to standardize on a battery type so I had just one charger and could interchange batteries between products.  After a lot of research, I chose B&D because I've liked their products in the past, the reviews seemed good, the prices are fine, and I don't really need more than this level of product.  I'm very happy with the result.I haven't had a problem with battery life so far, and across the multiple products I've purchased, I've gotten 3 batteries in total, so I've always got one available.  I did purchase a quick charger, which IMO is an absolute MUST.  The included charger is way too wimpy and shouldn't even be considered as a normal means of charge.  The quick charger is very fast, and I never need to worry about being out of power when I need it, across all the products I have.This drill has the power I need and includes a lot of extra little features that often come only with more expensive products, such as the LED that lights the work area.  It also comes with a screwdriver bit that attaches directly to a clip on the front of the drill, so I always have it when I need it.  Nice touch.  The weight is fine for my purposes and the batteries are easy to install and remove.Controls are straight forward and cover all the bases.  I'm not sure yet about the Autosense technology.  My projects have not yet needed the feature, but it looks interesting, at least.  The keyless chuck is easy to use and I never have any trouble with slipping.  The trigger is sensitive enough that I can control the speed quite well.The drill looks well built and solid.  I'm not worried about useful life at all.  There is nothing that looks or feels \"cheap\".  It's just a good, solid product for the home handyman.  My highest rating for this purpose.",

But, the LED work and drill / screw indicator lights are really cool; and, are the talk of my job sites.  Strangely, the auto-sensing feature actually works well, as does the deeper-setting function.  If you have other BD 20V tools and can use the extra battery and charger, go for this, just for the novelty.  Since BD owns Dewalt and Porter-Cable, this is likely the market prototype for heavier-duty commercial and industrial models.",

My reason for the two stars is that just as I was almost finished building a deck with it, I heard it pop and smoke started issuing from the drill where the battery plugs into it, it will also show that it has a full charge right up until it is getting ready to die. Even with these issues I was going to take it back to Lowe's(where it was purchased) but when I went to exchange it, there were none of the auto-sense cordless tools on the shelf at my Lowe's store.....might be a hint that these aren't all that great, as there weren't even any on display as it would be if they just had a run on them and sold out. Anyway, I just bought one of the cordless 20v drills with the clutch on it. We will see how it holds up.",

That being said, the Hitachi works just as well in every respect. Plus the Hitachi warranty (lifetime) puts the Makita two year to shame. You really can't go wrong with this set. Good price. Good quality. Superior warranty. Good ergonomics and design. Two batteries, where Makita has only one, and a Makita spare is quite an investment.I recommend getting the set with the standard drill as its only thirty bucks more at the time of this review and you get a nice tool bag to keep them in.",

If this is your first battery drill you will most likely love it and think it is is great if you get one that is working.  Of the 2 I received 1 works fine and the other is non functional and I am awaiting a replacement from the seller.  I purchased these because I have 4 12V Max Dewalt batteries and the price of replacement batteries for the drills I already own were nearly the cost of these drills.Pros:Lightweight and smaller than my other drills with equal power.Cons:The LED light is positioned totally wrong, it is below the chuck and casts a shadow on the surface area where you are about to drill or place a screw.  A spot of black paint over the light took care of that troublesome issue.The battery life is significantly less than any of the other drills I own with equal or greater power.The forward to reverse sliding switch is what I would call \"Micky Mouse\".  It is not a firm switch and has slack, frequently it interferes with the drill trigger and you have to make sure it is fully one way or the other.The ones I received were mid 2013 manufacture so I have concerns whetherf I will receive the full 3 year warranty from Dewalt.Summary:  I would have been better off to have purchased replacement batteries for the drills I already own.",

The drill kept making this ear piercing sound, almost like it was damaging the drill. The amount and power it put out declined and after 2-3 uses, the battery that I had to buy SEPERATELY stopped holding a charge. Overall this drill did not work as expected, so I bought another drill for around the same price. Same maker as well. Here is a link to the drill if you are interested http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FWLC9DI?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=B00FWLC9DI&linkCode=xm2&tag=jrsqe-20You have my warning!",

        "reviewText": "I have the larger and heavier model XR 3 speed drill something like the DEWALT DCD980M2 and have been really happy with it except for the weight. I thought the DEWALT DCD790B would be its little brother (metal chuck, lighter weight) but the rate at which the brake goes on in high gear is a completely a different experience. It just hits the WALL! Dead stop and an loud alarming noise as well. I thought it broke right out off the gate.I could live with the noise and the dead stop, but, it is so abrupt, the bits fall right out of the drill after a couple of high speed stops due to the inertia.My other drills do not have this effect even though they are just as fast on high speed. They certainly haul down fast enough yet don't have the explosive popping or loosening of the chuck that this version has.I am replacing it in hope I got an extreme one but I see that others have similar issues and already got an email for reconditioned ones today from CPO.To clarify, it only happens when in high gear (0-2000) and trigger is released abruptly. If you were to \"feather\" it down or are in the lower range, it is not a problem. I have tried with all my might to get the chuck tight enough to prevent it from releasing and to no avail. On the other drills NP.Maybe the chuck is not the same as well.Will try to follow up when replacement drill comes. I am keeping my fingers crossed...(6/1/15) Follow up on replacement. Much better! Chuck stays tight on bit and less noise when releasing trigger. Adding star (2 to 3) and after some real use will try to update again.",

I recently purchased the drill/driver base unit along with many of its Bolt-On tool attachments, which includes the Bolt-On circular saw and jig saw attachments I just used for the first time in my latest projects (a sewing table and a cutting table).  I was delightfully surprised at how well these tools performed and how effortless the Bolt-On system made the change between attachments quick and effortless.  The 20-volt max lithium-ion battery/charger worked well also; the battery seemed to last for hours before requiring a 25-35 minute re-charge.  I  also purchased the Bolt-On tool bag and found it not only keeps all my Bolt-On tools together in one place, but it has numerous pockets in which to store accessories (ie., saw blades, bits, etc).  Lastly, I give a 'thumbs-up' to Craftsman for the \"Bolt-On\" tools system--a fantastic design!",

        "reviewText": "It has powerful torque if the battery is charged enough, meaning not needing to be fully charged. It will countersink stainless steel screws in treated wood with the battery not fully charged. One big problem is the chuck collar. It can get frozen shut if opened too much, and then it's gone. I just threw one out a few minutes ago after attempting to spray WD-40 down in the chuck collar, and then having to try to use two channel locks to unscrew it from the frozen state. That started to chew up the rubber collar. I figured it would cost as much to send it off to a service center to get it fixed than buying an entire new carry case set. I had run into the same problem with a Task Force drill and could not unscrew it from being open too wide and then becoming frozen shut. I had to toss that drill also. Those are the old style drills with that type of chuck collar. Now drills have hex collars. Anyway, getting back to the Skil, I had a replacement drill that was in a markdown basket at a Lowes store that I bought for about 15 bucks, so I still have an entire kit. I will have to be extremely careful with the hand tightened chuck collar. I have an old metal Skil drill from the 60's that has a chuck tool gear tighten collar, and it has never frozen shut. Maybe the rubber coated hand tighten chuck collars tend to freeze shut if opened too wide.",

I love being able to figure out how to do stuff and fix stuff for myself rather than having to rely on my ex or hire someone.I purchased this to replace an 18V Milwaukee that my ex gave me (I have a great ex!) that I left behind at my cabin -- 1000 miles away.I love the fact that it is compact and lightweight.  The handy carrying case is also perfect for carrying it around and all together.However, it just isn't as solid as the Milwaukee and I could smell the engine burning when I would use it.  It works well for light applications but when I tried to use it to disassemble and reassemble my cube at work (with my employer's blessing), it just couldn't handle the job.  It is better suited for putting together furniture and hanging towel bars etc.If you want a heavy duty drill for half the price of the Milwaukee, I would recommend the\u00a0Bosch DDS181-102L 18-Volt Lithium-Ion 1/2-Inch Compact Tough Drill/Driver Kit with High Capacity Battery, Charger and L-BOXX-2.[NCJAR]",

I picked up the Skil 2898.  I went with this particular model because of the all metal gear train - the old one died because the nylon/plastic gears are stripped out.  There are a couple of things I think Skil should have retained.  To my disappointment, the light in the battery base in the old one is not on the 2898.  The 2898 also does not have the removeable drill guide on the heal of the driver (not a big deal, but it was handy on occasion).The Skil 2898 is solidly built. The chuck has no trouble holding a 1/2\" bit and the motor & drive train have the power to back it up. (Use the handle when drilling steel - there is some good torque if the bit binds!)  The batteries from my older 2887 work perfectly with the 2898, which for me is another bonus because I have several (I can also use them in the Skil C-saw, light and demo saw that came as part of a kit).",

        "reviewText": "I have in my life time, two dewalts and ryobi cordless drills. I've never used a smoother operating and stronger motor than the dewalt, hands down. The gears in those motors are solid and when you squeeze the trigger and feel it run - you know its quality. To make the story short, those batteries failed and buying new ones is just as costly as buying a whole new drill - forget it.I've used my ryobi drill (p200) since 2001 and it has given me faithful service. It died last week and I was quite sadden honestly. I only use it as a driver - all the drilling are relegated to my dewalt corded drills (they work wonderfully). If I could fix the ryobi - i would use it for another 14yrs wo fail. I honestly wanted another more compact and light weight drill - this black and decker fit the bill.I would never buy this product as my main driver based on their previous inferior quality tract record but this time, BD really up their game. I purchased this at Lowes and quickly bought this one off of Amazon b/c of the included quick charger- people please buy this on Amazon b/c it's $20 extra with the carry bag and they fast battery charger. The charger that came with my Lowes purchase, charged my battery in 8hrs - are you serious? The output is 400ma - I could put a new transistor in it to bump it up to 2a if I wanted to but I decided not to and purchased on Amazon instead (returning to Lowes asap).As I was making my purchase, my friend said to get a rigid drill/driver combo. I said no thanks - I like functionality over name. Plus I'm cheap - if you wanted to call me that. His dad has had a rigid cordless for 30yrs and all he had to do was replace batteries. Uhm my ryobi cost me $100 14yrs ago and I had replaced the battery for it once. Total cost within those 14yrs was $200 (100+70 for 2 batteries). His bad? I've seen him purchase 4 batteries so far at 100$ a pop. Plus the initial cost of the drill combo was $500? You do the math b/c I'm saving money and I'm getting something newer, more compact, and light weight. His dad complained that his drill was very heavy and that he couldn't perform some functions because of how bulky and long it was. No doubt, the his drill is solid and without fail, a better product b/c it's drive train is all metal - the BD is metal and plastic for savings production and weight wise. I don't like his drill b/c is bulky and HEAVY. Did I say HEAVY? I meant it.This drill is light weight and compact - the only reason I got it! I'm loving it though. It's funny how this drill design looks exactly like porter cable and dewalt - go check it out yourself. BD makes porter cable (i forgot, i have an 18v PC cordless as well - very powerful and crappy batteries - i use my ryobi more). I've used the standard 1.5ah battery driving 3\" deck screws for 6hrs + until it died - it wasn't constant driving one after another mind you. If I was building a deck, I would drive ALL my nails with my corded dewalt drills. Now that I have upgraded to the 4ah battery, it's going to be a monster! I cant praise this drill anymore higher than I already have!Drill by itself 2lb 3.1oz1.5ah 12.8oz | with the drill 3lb4.0ah battery 1lb 6.5oz | with the drill 3lb 9.7ozThis is a winner people! I don't know if this drill will last as long as my ryobi but frankly, I don't care! FYI when I use this to drive screws, its always on setting 1 and never 2. Good luck guys and gals!",

Despite a perfect NiCd drill, I opted to buy the lighter Li-ion version rather that spend an equivalent amount for a new charger and batteries.  The DDS181 came with one battery, a charger and a very nice case.  The battery has an exceptional long use time and fairly quick recharge rate.  I like the light on the drill target as well.  The slide switch is a bit tight when changing drill speed ranges.  Bosch makes very nice equipment.",

        "reviewText": "It started 3 years ago when I bought the Milwaukee 12v screw driver and never looked back. I now have 5 tools in the series as I am getting all my cordless tools paired down to the same brand and batteries. I have had my eye on the right angle drill for a while, but waited until I needed it to buy one. I was installing new drawer slides for our kitchen cabinets and had nothing to get in there and drill and screw in the new hardware...SO... I now have one and love it! Besides fitting where I needed it (with a shortened drill bit) it glides smoothly through the speeds. A nice chuck that snugs up tight and a well placed fwd-rev toggle that I can comfortably reach with my little finger while drilling..nice touch Milwaukee! My only wish would be for TWO \"white\" L.E.D. lights (or add one more?) the red torque L.E.D. is nice, but I rather have more light. I thought the other light was not working until I read the manual. Apparently some others in the reviews are also mistaken thinking one light is broken and unfortunately gave fewer stars. I gave this 5 stars because it is a well thought out tool design with a good warranty and feels good in the hand. If you need or want a 90 deg angle drill this is it!",

It has a 0-600rpm selectable via a dial. The reason for my lower rating is that one of the LED lights that would illuminate the work area is non functioning. 5 Star tool, but 2 star experience",

You get the drill, two batteries, the charger, a nice hard case, and a useful selection of screwdriver bits.  I also own a 12V Dewalt equivalent, and it cost $25 more and didn't come with a hard case or the screwdriver bits.The Hitachi DS10DFL2 12V feels very nice in your hand.  It is lightweight, well balanced, and has a great feeling grip.  Everything is right where you'd expect it to be too.  Speed control on top.  Direction change right above and slightly behind the trigger.This drill has plenty of power to drive a 3\" screw through a pressure treated deck board and into the deck frame.  No problem.  I believe you could use this drill to do an entire deck job.  So it will be more than satisfactory for the average home use.The speed control is very granular and easy using the trigger, and the chuck action is very simple and accurate, so bits are easy to load and unload.  The batteries are small and light yet provide quite a bit of uses per charge, and they charge relatively quick.  My Dewalt batteries are a little easier to attach and remove, but that is a very minor difference.All in all, this drill is winner.  I had never tried a Hitachi cordless power tool until now, but this drill has made a believer out of me.",

This impact tool put his power drill to shame!!!  He talks about it every time we have a conversation.  It is extremely powerful and lighter weight with a smaller body.  It has the convenience of a belt clip and an LED light that turns on while you are using the tool.  It comes with just basic bits, so it would be nice to have more for the \"odder\" jobs.  He is ecstatic to replace his old cordless drill with this Hitachi, and I am ecstatic that a few things have been done around my house that I couldn't really do myself.  Oh, it only takes about half an hour to charge a battery (2 batteries are included), and the charge lasts hours upon hours.  This is definitely a good deal for the price.  Highly recommended!",

It's great that it comes in a case with bits so I can keep everything together in the case and nothing gets lost....which is a problem with items of this type when they don't come with a case. I bonus for me is that it has a belt clip so I can free up my hands while I'm doing something, but still have the drill right there when I'm ready to use it. While I also have a 20V drill, I like this one for certain jobs as it is smaller. Overall I am very happy with this drill and will see how the battery lasts.

        "reviewText": "I just realized that I posted my review for the New model before I did the Old one. Here is what I have to say:So as you may have guessed, I like this system. I like it so much I looked around the internet to find and explain this system to other people. I own three Matrix drills (2 of this model and 1 New model) and use them for all my projects. TL;DR This thing rocks.I got into this system in September 2014: I don't have much storage space, but I needed to get some power tools for a ton of projects. I was going to get one of those beginner power tool sets that many brands sell: four big tools and one battery for $200. As I was comparing these sets in-store I noticed the this Matrix and a couple of accessories that were near by. I love multifunctional items, this system was (at the time) seven tools in one for about $250, and could be stored in a bag anywhere!I ended up being very lucky as many sales and discounts came my way. At one point I ended up just buying another drill for its battery because it was the same price as an individually sold battery. Because of how many projects I ended up doing I also bought two 4.0 Amp hour batteries and a Quick Charge Station. (20-45 min for a drained 1.5 amp, 1-2 hour for a drained 4.0 amp [temperature plays a role]) Later on I found the second drill essential as it would be switched to while the first drill cooled off.This \"power unit\" brought me back into my workshop, a yard (as the only open enough space), and helped me finish a desk, shelf, table, deck, and shed. Each accessory had a part to play and took me through projects quickly, I could carry two attachments with me with one on the unit and switched between them in seconds to move quickly and efficiently. I recommend the 4.0 Amp Hour battery as it pushes the motor through possible bog down situations. It may seem odd but it can be felt just how differently the motor reacts to resistance with different batteries. By the way, the sparks in the motor are normal as this is a brushed motor, but smoke and fire are not.If you are going to use this \"unit\" like a contractor uses power tools, be warned: This thing can overheat and kill itself as you may have read in other reviews. I doubt simple projects will hurt the \"unit\" but working on my shed and deck, near constant heavy use over a short period of time, pushed this thing to its limits, 'forcing' me to bring out my reserve one to give the first one a break. But lets be clear, that \"unit\" I mentioned is fine and works great, I just didn't like that it was so hot. The new model has been redesigned and the heat problems are gone.My most used and favorite is a tie between the Circular Saw and the Impact Driver though the Sander and Jigsaw are close behind. The Routing attachment and Oscillating Tool have been interesting and fun to use but are niche as intended. The battery hogs are the Sander and Oscillator though the Saw can kill a battery quickly (constant use: 1.5 amp 10-20 min, 4.0 amp 1-2 hour). The drill/driver is what it is. The Circular Saw has some quirks, I don't use the \"guide line\" and shouldn't be used to cut more than 3/4\" thick wood, what it can cut through solely depends on the blade and how sharp it is. The Impact Driver is a beast and with a 4.0 Amp battery can sometimes remove lug nuts. The Sander is fantastic for sanding, who'da thought. The Jigsaw is only as good as its blades. The Router is awkward but works (see questions answered). The Oscillation Tool can bog down but is awesome as a scraper/paint/rust remover as it is harsher than the sander. The Inflation attachment works and can inflate balls and tires but has a \"might burn you because it gets so hot\" negative. The Reciprocating Saw attachment is alright but I haven't given it much testing.Opening the power unit will likely void your warranty. Watch out for the selector spring, attachment detector spring (a plastic nub that is pushed in when an attachment is... attached, and prevents the motor from activating without an attachment on the unit), and springy attachment holding ring. If these are not placed in the exact correct positions the unit may not function properly. Its nice to get a good look at what is going on in there however and shows a few key things. The motor is \"closed\" = when the brushes on the motor are gone they cannot be replaced and a new motor or more likely new unit must be bought. The wiring job is a little off and will likely succumb to \"wire fatigue\" because of their placement and inadequate soldering at connections. Keeping in mind that these issues only present after two or three years, this is all acceptable and more than enough for the price.I really like this \"unit,\" I should as I own two of them. And the New model is even better.",

I've used plenty of drills before but never had my own so when I found this one and on sale, I pulled the trigger. I'm not in construction or anything where I'd need it for heavy duty work so I knew this would work for my home needs. There just wasn't any need for me to buy a $200+ drill. I researched before buying, read reviews and watched videos and bought with confidence as everywhere I looked, the reviews were very positive for this as a good standard drill. I like the look, feel, and the weight . It's solid and well built. So far, I've used it quite a few times and it's done everything I've needed without any trouble at all. The battery has also lasted for the duration of my projects, which is good to see. I bought a backup though just in case.The only complaints I've seen are from people who are trying to compare this drill with much more expensive and high end models. This drill wasn't meant for that. It's for home and basic needs, nothing more, but it exceeds expectations in that area. This is great value for what you get and especially for the attachments available. I plan on getting the sander and impact driver soon. The saws also look very promising. It all adds up to the B&D Matrix being a great choice for someone looking for a good, all around drill. Recommended.",

This drill does everything I want it to do, and all of its functions work well.  I particularly like the small magnets that are on the top of the housing.  They work great for keeping 2-3 bits.  The batteries seems to be functioning perfectly after all of this time.  The drill is powerfiul, has two speeds, and the clutch works great. Take your finger off the trigger and the drill stops almost immediately (good for avoiding overdriving in soft materials). The drill is also reasonably short, so it is good for getting into most tight spaces.  I' buy it again without question.  I don't remember whether I bought it from Amazon, but since I use Amazon so much and since this review system is such a boon to customers, I thought I'd enter this information.",

This unit works perfectly, and comes with a nice assortment of drivers. It's also a nice size that fits my small hand well, and it's bright and easy to locate when I have tools strewn everywhere. I still grab my power drill when I need to drill holes, but I use the Rockwell for everything else. I actually like having two separate drills-- I can drill pilot holes with the power drill and drive the screws with the driver, without having to keep changing them in the chuck.

It works very well.This Pivoting Right Angle Drill/Driver compliments my cordless drill.  When I am doing a bit of drilling and then driving, it's easier to have two different units instead of swapping out.  Also this will go into some tighter spaces than the cordless drill.Only one problem with the design.  You have to get specific drill and screw driver bits for it, you can not use the standard drill bits you would use for a keyless chuck.  I gave up that flexibility for the ability to manuver in spaces my cordless drill could not.  Overall, a good trade off.",

If you try to operate the drill without pressing the test button, it will fail. It will fail during idle time so you must press the test button to start it again. If you  try a battery without the test button, you will be out-of-luck. It took me over a month to figure this out and I wish I had returned it. It's out of warranty  now so I am stuck. When I bought this on-line from Sears, the return policy did not include return-to-any-store as it does now. On the good side, the lithium battery that came with my drill is always ready - not like the Ni-Cd models I also have.",

This family of tools are possibly the best power tool purchases that I have made. I'm planning to get the 12v reciprocating saw too. I wish they would add a 3/8 ratchet like Milwaukee has.",

So I took it back and luckily it was replaced (under protest) but it still isn't good.  After only ONE WEEK, the chuck does not stay tight and the bit falls out.

And of course the hugest bonus: it shares batteries and chargers with your other Hitachi 12V Peak tools!  This grinder does get a little warm with extended heavier use so that you may have to let it cool down from time to time for the longer, harder projects. It will let you know if you're overloading it, when a red LED near the battery holder will come on and not turn off whilst the tool remains overloaded. You must then reduce loading, or sometimes it requires a full shutoff first.  I believe this LED is actually a low battery indicator, so the deader the battery the easier it comes on with the same loading (due to battery voltage drop under load), and the longer it takes to go dark again once shut off.  Incidentally these Hitachi 12V Peak tool batteries used (maybe still do) Samsung INR18650 13Q cells (1.3 amp hour.)",

I have to use a kung fu death grip in order to get a bit in so that it won\u2019t spin in the chuck instead of cutting wood.  I\u2019m talking ordinary pine, not anything hard or exotic.  I picked up the Porter-Cable PCC601 which seems to be basically the same drill except with a much nicer chuck.  The P-C chuck is a huge improvement over the B&D, no king fun necessary.  I\u2019ll keep the Black & Decker but the Porter-Cable will probably get most of the use.",

So I avoid using it, I am never sure that the bit will remain in the chuck.HAVING THE BIT FALL OUT DURING THE MIDDLE OF AN OPERATION IS DANGEROUS LET ALONE ANNOYING.",

Got it at a decent price. Had enough torq to do most of what I asked of it and the battery was pretty good. Then about 2 months prior to the warranty going out the motor smoked itself. just on basic screws too. That took me back a bit. Warranty replacement wasnt too big of an issue, shipped out all my stuff and the gave me a whole new set. Sounds good right? Well the new batteries looked different than the old ones. Originals were a glossy finish, these new ones were a satin. They are ABYSMAL! I can barely finish a basic job like putting together a desk without them dying, and even though it has 2 batteries, they will not hold a charge for more than a couple days.Pathetic! and at the replacement price for batteries there is no way I am going to replace them for a drill that I like a little bit. Dewalt 18v price is really reasonable these days so spend the extra couple of bucks and get the best tool in the business.",

That was wishful thinking it turns out. This drill isn't anywhere near the workhorse that the old blue ones were. First of all, the chuck is terrible-- won't hold the bits very well-- and the lithium battery just shuts off when it gets low.  You get very little warning that the battery is running low... it's all or nothing. Also, seems like there is a thermal breaker in there somewhere, so the drill shuts down if it gets hot.  It doesn't take much heavy use for that too happen.  My battery now needs replacing and I think I'll just buy a new drill.",

Battery life is good, I can go about a week of moderate use before switching batteries, three days of its heavily used. It doesn't get hott like others I have used and the trigger is easily manipulated for speed regulation. Overall I'm pleased with it.

        "reviewText": "Can't say enough good about this drill.I was wary about buying one of these because of bad reviews, but then again most lithium-ion tools have bad reviews (mainly because of the batteries and not the tool).Needless to say I was so impressed by the tool that I bought a second one for myself and a third for my father as a father's-day gift (2014). All are still working great! I use my two drills nearly every weekend on woodworking and automotive projects, and they work all day long without complaint. I only have issues if I'm trying to do big-drill stuff with these little drills (like forcing long screws through hardwood or running hole-saws). Remember it's a light-duty job-drill, not a planet-spinning heavy-duty drill.For automotive I use the drills typically for small fastener removal (it doesn't have anywhere near the torque to handle bolts and such).For woodworking I primarily work with MDF 3/4 and above, pine, composites, and some lighter hardwoods. Happily drills up to at least 3/8's with standard drill bits. Successfully drills forstner bits (biggest I use is 1-1/2\") and hole saw bits (biggest I can do with these is about 1 inch). Has no problem pushing 2-3\" wood screws into just about anything.The drill itself is great. Pretty slim and fits well in the hand. Not too heavy and it has withstood being dropped and rough-handled. Only thing I don't like is that there's no easy way to let go of it...by that I mean there's no provision for a lanyard, no belt-clip capability either. You either have to holster it in your pocket (which it's small enough to do so pretty easily) or put it down completely. Not really that big of a deal, though. Except for when I'm climbing on something, I haven't really had the need for a strap or belt-clip. It would probably fit in a typical drill holster with no problems.I think the only thing to go wrong with either of my drills has been the numbers around the chuck for the torque settings. Most of them have worn off by now, and since they're just painted on and not recessed there's nothing left after the paint goes. Not a big deal here, either, since you pretty much know twisting it one way makes it lighter on torque and the other way beefs it up. Not rocket science here, folks. My numbers probably came off due to a combination of automotive grime (brake fluid, oils, cleaners and solvents) and lots of use. If the numbers were vital I'd be upset but anyone should be able to figure out how the drill works and not need them.",

        "reviewText": "Overall I am quite impressed with this little drill. While it is not a \"main\" drill, or made for heavy duty tasks, it is a nice compliment to a tool collection for smaller task at hand. The drill has a nice feel to it, all controls being easy to reach and operate. It has a nice, quality heft to it, and while I wouldn't call this drill lightweight,  it is lighter than my 19.2v drill and smaller in all profiles. It is great to have for lighter jobs and hard to access areas. The smaller size batteries are are easier to transport as well. Heck, you can throw an extra in your pocket if you like. Craftsman finally got the light right, allowing the LED to be activated before the rotation of the chuck. The light is extremely handy, whether trying to line up  on a screw head, or putting a bit onto a centerpunch mark in a dim area. The adjustable torque setting, while not something I tend to use, has a solid feel to it, and works well. The torque that this little guy puts out is nothing short of amazing, and while I wouldn't build a deck with it, it drove  3\" screws into a piece of wood over and over again like it was nothing. I generally won't be using it for those type of jobs, but it's nice to know that it has the muscle to do so if needed. My only disappointment is in the lack of a battery meter on the drill itself. Older versions seem to have it, as they are shown on older videos and discussed by Craftsman themselves. There is one on most other Nextec tools, I am looking at one on my Nextec Multi Tool as we speak/write. It is a handy feature and one that would be easy and cheap enough to include, I'm not sure why Craftsman would decide to remove it. That feature is on the 19.2V batteries themselves, and is one that I use all of the time. Perhaps the 12v batteries will include it in the future. In summary, this is a great little drill for smaller jobs, fits great in a tool belt or box and has lots of power. The battery seems to last a long time and charges up quickly. Perfect if used in the right application.",

This kit is the biggest piece of junk I've ever purchased. The drill is extremely weak. It never drills screws in all the way, it usually chokes up about a quarter of an inch away so that you need to use the screw diver to finish the job by hand. As if that wasn't enough, when you go to reach for the standard screw driver, you realize that both the phillips head and flathead screw drivers are too big to fit most of the screws that you use. That leaves you stuck with using the screw driver that uses the bits. Not only are the bits extremely hard to pull out of the holder, but they don't stay well in the socket so they pop out a lot.If you're looking for a tool kit to anything around the house from putting together furniture to putting up curtains, DO NOT buy this set. I do not usually write bad reviews but I needed to write one for this product to save someone else for making the same mistake I did.",

I was at first hesitant to buy an \"off brand\" (not really since Bostich is well known for other types of tools), but other reviewer's comments made me confident this is a good bargain and I am certainly happy that I made the purchase. The drill has plenty of power for my purposes and, since it comes with two batteries, I don't have to worry about the battery conking out in the middle of a job. The keyless chuck works very well. I have access to an almost $300 drill at work and the chuck on this drill works as well as the chuck on that expensive drill. This drill also comes with a very nice plastic case which has room for the drill, both batteries and the charger if you're careful about packing the charger's power cord in correctly.",

(I bought this unit elsewhere before finding it on Amazon).I've had this for well over 6 months now and have used it extensively. I've always been a fan of DeWalt and Porter Cable.This \"unit\" has literally out performed all that I own and owned in the past. The power is superb and with the two batteries that come withit...EXCELLENT buy at Amazon's price. Both batteries hold their charge well and all around, I would recommend this two thumbs up.Great price and if you are looking to purchase a hard working Drill Motor and great battery performance, this one is hard to beat for theprice and quality. 5 Stars all the way.",

Used for that purpose and during the course, the chuck got progressively more difficult to manipulate to swap out drill bit for driver bits.  But finished the project.  Drill goes unused for a few months and I pull it back out for another around the home 'fixit' job.  Within a couple switches, the the bit is completely locked up and cannot be removed,  with all my might.  Gun otherwise works, so it has permanently become an electronic screwdriver.  Which is of little use to me.  If i want to drill I need to buy a new gun anyway as the warranty is long expired.I will be looking at other brands as I have experience with quite a few over the years and not experienced this type of failure.  I would not consider 2 light jobs (probably combined 20 minutes of work) of work a reasonable period of time for a tool to fail like it has.Otherwise, battery life and overall function (before it failed) was acceptable given the low cost.  Hopefully i just got a bad unit.",

At first I was let down because I had wanted a BIG drill, like a DeWalt or Makita, but after some projects I really started to like this handy drill.  I have used it for just about every possible task you could imagine using or abusing a drill with.  The first few tasks were simple \"honey do\" items like hanging pictures, fixing trim, etc.  I have since used this as the primary drill to put up about 100Ft of wooden fence, and I did all the composite decking and stairs on my 10x10 deck. I also have used it to drill out old bolts in some automotive suspension parts as well as used it in the junkyard. Below are my Pros and Cons.Pros:CompactLightEasy to Carry in a tool bagCharges quickPretty durablePrice is great!Cons:I wish the chuck was larger sometimesSmall battery gets used quick, during long jobs the battery will not charge if I was using the drill recentlyFirst battery that came with the drill died and failed to chargeI gave it 5 stars because I am pretty sure the dril exceeds the intended usage in my case!It has slipped on the bit before when drilling metal",

        "reviewText": "I was using this drill in a professional environment, but had to return it.The overall features are good.  Decent tool size, especially with respect to its nice torque output and bit speed.  Significant weight reduction, particularly in consideration of the previous 18V model with the bigger batteries.  More comfortable to use on a ladder, where tool weight is particularly noticeable and makes a difference  Two speeds, even though I keep it on the fastest anyway.  Light for illuminating work, even though it is somewhat misaligned.BUT, if you are using this tool in a job where you are constantly starting/stopping the chuck (e. g. starting holes in metal work), bits will fall out of the chuck!  This tool stops the chuck with what seems like mechanical means immediately applied (i.e.  a brake or pawl that immediately comes out to make spinning assemblies stop) upon release of the trigger.  You can't gently release the trigger to overcome or control this action.  The chuck will always immediately CLANK to a stop.  This causes the chuck to loosten and allow your drill bit, bit holder, etc.  to just FALL OUT.I've been at my workbench and watched bits fall out within 10 releases of the chuck.  I've been on ladders, and have watched my bit holders fall out, and the most entertaining part of that is the additional height make bit holders travel farther when they're dropped!  I did eventually start \"double-checking\" the chuck regularly, and I always had to tighten it.  This became old.I replaced it with a red one that came from somewhere out in Wisconsin, and that served as a timely solution to the issue.",

        "reviewText": "If I could give it 6 stars, I would. Hell, 11 stars..This is the best cordless drill I've ever owned. I've owned 4, this is my 5th. I had (still have) the \"baby blue/turquoise\" stalwart Makita, Milwaukee, Black and Decker, and another I can't' remember right now.This is by far the most powerful cordless drill I've ever owned.It is the easiest to use.It has great clutch points with a WIDE range.It has a work light pointing at where you are drilling (not powerful but very useful).It has two torque modes.It is very lightweight for its power, and perfectly balanced in the hand. Very well designed.And, the thing that I still can't get over:  I bought/received this drill and battery during the first week of Dec. 2014. I charged up the 20V batter with supplied charger fully before first use (hey, I follow the rules, man).Then, I proceeded to use this drill on a \"every third day\" or so basis, doing a wide variety of jobs around the new house (purchased a new home last year and have been doing TONS of home projects), from heavy drilling jobs to a million dollar network upgrade project I used it for at work, to the normal \"screw this, tighten that\" type stuff. And I do mean, at least twice a week I've used this since owning it; doing runtime duty of 10 minutes (over a few hours) to an hour of continuous use....And...The battery didn't die until May 20th, 2015. That's over 6 MONTHS of continuous significant use without having to charge the battery, with no loss of power or effectiveness until it needed charging. Swapped in the 2nd charged battery and I was back up and running (and, btw, within a couple hours the original battery was charged fully again and ready to go).I suspect I won't need to swap the other one in until my purchase anniversary / December....As a dedicated DIY'er, this is the best purchase I have made in years, and I expect, based on the workmanship/quality of this drill, that I won't need to replace it for a decade or longer (granted that they keep making compatible batteries)..A very happy customer.",

        "reviewText": "I'm a big do-it-yourselfer. Before owning this drill, I was making do with a clutchless, corded Milwaukee 3/8\" chuck drill and an old Skil brand 12v drill/driver that I literally found in the garage- no idea regarding provenance. So even though this drill failed on me (it \"let the smoke out\") 6 months in, I still want to give it 3 stars, because it did let me complete a number of projects. My DCD790 drill has currently been with DeWalt for warranty repairs for almost a month and a half now, and I don't know when (if ever) I'll get it back, so keep that in mind.I used this drill to put in tons of GRK construction screws when I was building a fence and gate for the yard, and also used it to mix up buckets of tile grout when I redid one of my bathrooms; in each case the drill was up to the task. I want to mention that out of the box, like the 12v impact driver cousin, this drill had noticeable wobble in the chuck. I haven't used a drill in this category that didn't have at least some wobble, but it was pronounced with the DeWalt.The drill had enough torque to drive 1/2\" diameter lag bolts ~5-6\" deep into 4x4 beams, as well as enough torque to drive a 1-1/4\" self-feed bit (although I don't recommend trying this). Battery life was good even with the standard small battery- the kit I bought had 2 batteries so I could charge one and cycle them out, but even if I only had one battery, I think the charge time is low enough to not be a big nuisance. The chuck, despite the wobble, was actually pretty good (compared to the Milwaukee M18 that I now have since I can't wait 2 months for DeWalt to warranty repair mine), with very little play in the sleeve and the ability to really crank down on a shank without jamming up and being impossible to loosen.What killed my drill was using it with a 1/2\" square drive head to turn a scissor jack's lead screw, trying to lift up one corner of a solid oak desk (maybe 400lbs?). This surprised me, as I feel I had put it through much more punishing tasks, and I've used lesser drills with the same scissor jack to lift up my CAR.Update: Finally got the drill back after 2 months. Repair center said it was not the motor, but some of the variable speed control circuitry that was fried.",

This drill is very lightweight, easy to handle, with great speed control. I tried using my old drill after using this one and it felt like trying to drive a screw with a cinder block. My only warning is after buying this, I really wanted the impact drill also. The impact is even lighter and it's easy to switch bits.

It works great for most homeowner tasks - I've hung drywall and cement board, drilled dozens of holes, disassembled multiple appliances, etc., and it works great.  The Li-Ion battery is marvelous - if I go two months without using it, the battery is still charged and usable (compared with my old NiCad tools).That said, it's a light duty drill.  If you want to drive 4\" spikes into a piece of lumber, this isn't the right tool.  If, however, you want to drive a 2\" screw through drywall into your 2x4 studs, it works great. I have a wired DeWalt drill that I end up pulling out once a year or so to deal with jobs that aren't appropriate to this drill.  But this is certainly the first thing I pick up and try to use.",

This drill does everything I want it to do, and all of its functions work well.  I particularly like the small magnets that are on the top of the housing.  They work great for keeping 2-3 bits.  The batteries seems to be functioning perfectly after all of this time.  The drill is powerfiul, has two speeds, and the clutch works great. Take your finger off the trigger and the drill stops almost immediately (good for avoiding overdriving in soft materials). The drill is also reasonably short, so it is good for getting into most tight spaces.  I' buy it again without question.  I don't remember whether I bought it from Amazon, but since I use Amazon so much and since this review system is such a boon to customers, I thought I'd enter this information.",

Found this deal at $60, which was only $20 more but resulted in having an extra driver to speed up jobs where installing numerous screws/fasteners requiring pilot holes.  Use one drill for pilot holes & 2nd one to drive the screws, without having to change out drill bits and then driver bits.  Glad I found it.  Has plenty of power, even for boring 1/2\" holes in metal (& wood).  One thing I'd like to see improved is the gripping power of the chuck on large bits (without hex shanks), which will sometimes spin in the chuck when bit binds in metal.  That never (practically) happens with a Dewalt, which has far superior chuck.  As they say, \"You get what you pay for.\"",

Also this tool is so large and bulky, it defeats the purpose of a small angle drill/driver.I probably would not buy one of these again unless it was a corded one with a lot of power for the big jobs when it's truly needed.So far the best little 12V Bosch I have is the PS130B hammer drill.

I theorized the electrical components of this drill would easily take the additional voltage, and they do.  As expected, torque and speed are greatly increased and I am able to drive 2 1/2\" screws into wood without a problem.  I know the gears and other mechanical components are not designed for the additional torque and this will not last long.  I just wish B&D and other manufacturers would realize the potential of a small drill/driver like this and reinforce the gears.  In the meantime I will enjoy the additional power while it lasts...",

I've used it to install a few closet doors and hang some things on walls, no big jobs, but it works great. My only complaint is that there's a piece of rubber/plastic at the top rear of the grip with rough ridges in it, exactly where the webbing between my thumb and palm lands during use. Seems like a poor ergonomic choice to put something jagged next to the softest part of the hand. I solved it with a piece of black electrical tape to cover the gaps.",

At this price point you are not going to get the most powerful or durable tools.  I burned out an earlier model handle.  Make sure you get the \"C\" model identified with a light on the handle and the bit storage on top.  Apparently the earlier handle had a tendency to overheat.  B&D replaced it without having to return the destroyed part.  The batteries are light and powerful.  I recommend you get at least one larger battery and the AC powered handle for extended operation.  I have every attachment except the power inflator which gets poor reviews and I don't need anyway.  All the attachments work well.  I especially like the small trim saw.  It is small, portable, and handy.  However, it only cuts about an inch of material so you have to cut both sides of 2x material.  The reciprocating saw looks funny but works better than most.  The short length makes it easy to maneuver.  This is the only attachment I have broken and again B&D was quick with a replacement.  I keep the Matrix in my RV and the space and weight savings are tremendous.  Highly recommended for everything except a dedicated construction site.",

This has exceptional power  and isn't too heavy. However I wish the drill head slanted upward more to give a more natural hand position like the 14.4 volt unit. Also my 14.4 has 2 speed which is very help when drilling holes. 1 speed is a drawback on this 20 volt unit.  I am quite satisfied though overall. I would recommend buying this drill.",

I bought it specifically to install latches on roughly 100 casement and transom windows in an old house.  I particularly needed the variable angle feature for a lot of small vertical and horizontal spaces, particularly when I was 15 feet in the air at the top of a ladder and could not move myself around to a different position.  It took about 30 seconds to get the feel of the variable speed.  Some of the reviews questioned the lack of a torque adjustment.  At least for the woods I was working with (mahogany, cypress and old growth pine), the drill was a breeze to control and I did not strip a single brass screw.  The LED light is a terrific feature and I find myself grabbing it and pulling the trigger just to use the light to find something in my toolbox.  Highly recommended.",

        "reviewText": "Agree with the majority here, this kit is a good value, with adequate power and quality for home and light commercial use. I've had my eye on this kit for a while, waiting for a good sale. I stumbled upon it at a home improvement store on sale for 80 bucks, which is a fantastic value. The main attractions for me were, the good quality DeWalt chuck, 2 speeds making it great for drilling and driving, compact size, and the batteries fit my old B&D Firestorm tools. (pretty good tools, but batteries died and are now uber expensive). The charger is pretty sophisticated, though it is very light. That worries me, usually lightweight stuff doesn't have much copper in it, and doesn't last. There is no annoying power brick, making me ownder how the charger can be so light. Since portable drills are battery packs with a free drill included, the importance of the charger can not be overestimated. Many chargers will not cut off when charged, and will thus overcharge your battery packs if you forget them. All it takes are 2 or 3 overcharges and your pack is on the way to early failure. This one cuts off, I guess when the battery pack reaches a certain temperature (pretty hot). If left on, it goes into a maintenance charge mode, and if left on longer, it goes into a \"cell leveling\" mode that's supposed to keep your battery packs in top shape. I don't know about all that business, but I do know most battery packs are ruined by over charging (using the last bit of current is also destructive). So we'll see. If my packs last over 2 years, they will easily beat my old 12v Makita and 14.4v B&D units. (I have no use for 18v or higher voltage).Only down side so far, the high gear is not quite high enough. I wish it would turn 2000 RPM, but it only turns ~1500. Also the gear shift switch is a little sticky and annoying, maybe it will loosen up.",

        "reviewText": "Very nice drill and excellent value over all for random use around the house. I haven't run across any situation where the drill is obviously lacking power/torque but I wouldn't purchase a drill with any less voltage as I have a feeling it's just enough to get the job done in certain situations such as drilling larger pilot holes in wood. It fits very well in your hand, not too heavy but not too light to make it feel cheap. The charger can be a little finicky and is definitely a little cheap so I'd watch out for that. I was looking forward to buying additional attachments for the drill and bought the sander. I was slightly disappointed with it but that is for another review.The downfall to this drill is the battery replacements cost almost as much as the actual drill and the drill does not come with any case or bits other than the typical screw-driver bit so plan on making a few other purchases if you don't already own those things. If you don't plan on buying multiple batteries this is a great product offering you lots of versatility and mobility. If you plan on using this drill all day non-stop then I'd maybe look in to buying the plug-in version which I believe has more power anyway or accept the fact that you'll be buying multiple batteries and spending two or three times the cost of the drill. Battery life when fully charged should last you a couple of little projects around the house most of the day (building an Ikea bed, installing bathroom towel racks, etc).For most people randomly using a drill here and there this drill is sufficient and offers the added benefit of versatility with the attachments.",

        "reviewText": "It' s not a bad drill, but... like some people said the shaft may have some play, but not really noticeable with regular drill bits. But I may be inclined to think that with longer bit, i.e. 13 inches or more for drilling a hole into thick wall for example, it may have some lateral play, or cause some vibration to the hand while holding it. But with normal operation, I doubt if it is any noticeable.One problem that does happen with this drill is that, the two- stage, joint shaft will produce more noise. the noise while operating the drill for regular jobs may be a number of times greater than using another fixed drill. There were times that I thought I reach for ear protection (mufflers), just to finish the job a little easier. The shaft produces, I' d say probably a bit noticeably more noise on this drill than regular drills. Not really a problem, but some people, i.e. in extended application, long- time use, they may use some ear protection to lower the dBs.I bought two of these drills by the way mostly because of their versatility in changing over to different tool.",

This tool is certainly not meant for the professional day in and day out builder etc. However, for home use, this is a very sturdy and very useful tool. the item as purchased is basically a cordless drill/driver. However, the tool shines when you consider the fact that you can add several other tool attachments to perform other jobs (e.g. a trim saw, a sander, an impact driver etc.) I ordered the impact driver and it is very solid and effective. If you are looking for a bit more power, the 20V would be a nice choice. However, this 12V model is adequate for the jobs I do. I put new boards on my old wooden fence and the tool performed very well. It's a nice space saver in the tool bag too, since there is only 1 base unit and multiple tool heads. I'd recommend for home use.",

No scratches or dings on the drill itself.I got this as a gift for myself to replace my current 12v drill. If I depended on this thing everyday I would have purchased at Home Depot so that I could register the warranty with Ridgid.I tested it out when it arrived and this little thing has more torque than I expected. It is well balanced and everything seems to work.-1 star because I believe that it could have been cleaned up a little better.",

The charger works with both Li-Ion and the old-style batteries, and the batteries fit into Ridgid tools that take the old batteries. The only complaint we had is that the chuck comes loose and requires frequent tightening but if you're not using the drill heavily it's not much of an issue.",

It's great to grab for just about any job except for drilling larger holes in wood, steel, or concrete.I used to use my Porter Cable 19.2v drill to mix thinset mortar.  This is not for that use.",

Off you go on drilling and screwing at all angles. Super great power too.The battery last a long time - but not long enough to build a deck or a major project. So you'll want to consider the need for a 2nd battery. The charger is pretty fast - but unless you need or want to take a break when it needs charging - consider a 2nd battery. Certainly you can wait - just not if you're about to start a big remodel or other project.",

        "reviewText": "I picked this drill for two reasons:One: It is MUCH smaller and MUCH lighter than ordinary cordless drills, which is a great boon for my old, arthritic joints. Ergonomically I find it excellent. If I ever had to work in tight quarters - say - under a sink, this drill will be easy, and a full-size cordless might be well-nigh impossible.  It will also be far easier to use for my model aircraft building work than any full-size cordless.  So much more maneuverable!Two: It is brushless.  Brushless motor controllers by their nature can provide much better speed and torque modulation.  This one is infinitely variable, where a lot of bigger drills are just two-speed.  When driving Phillips-head screws you can start out very slowly to prevent the bit from camming out of the screw head.  Something my old 2-speed B&D was altogether too good at.Battery capacity is such that you won't be using this to drive half a zillion deck screws, nor for drilling half-inch holes in boiler plate, but for typical household repair/maintenance jobs, it is perfect.  The 200 inch-pounds of torque was more than plenty to drive 3-inch #10 screws into the rock hard oak framing in my antique abode, which is the first job I did with it.  Battery indicator still shows \"full\", BTW, after pre-drilling the backerboard with a masonry bit as well as driving the screws.A plus feature of the Li-ion battery is its' very low self-discharge rate.  If I charge this and don't use it for a month or two, it'll still be ready to go, unlike NiCad and NiMH cells which will be half-way to flat in that time.  (If you know that the tool won't be used for, say, a year, it's best to discharge the battery about halfway, however. They keep better that way.)3/8\" keyless chuck works fine.  There's been some griping on-line about Bosch keyless chucks, but it doesn't apply to this one.Bottom line - I paid nearly double what a consumer grade Lowes/Home Despot cordless drill goes for, and I'd do it again in a heartbeat.",

Functionally, both models are good and either would be a great choice for a light to medium duty driver-drill. They both feel good in the hand.

The speed control via the trigger is fluid and just the right sensitivity, and this thing has power when you need it, but it will drive at a very low speed while maintaining a high force, so whether you're putting a screw through hard or soft wood or a knot, the same trigger position will move it at the same rate.  The LED light is not so much useful when actually driving as it is to have a tool with a light available nearby when working after dark.  I'll pick the drill up, touch the trigger, the light comes on and stays on a bit, check the work out, then use a different tool, so even though the light doesn't shine directly on the targeted screw or drill location, it's quite useful.  The batteries last forever, used one for 8 hours one day before it ran low.  They charge fast too.",

Recently, companies have been coming out with adapter kits that allow you to use a cordless drill attached to an auger bit. Still drills through the ice, but it's much lighter and you don't have to worry about smelly gas.I used this drill for such a purpose.In combination with the Clam Outdoors adapter plate and a new Lazer 8\" hand auger bit, it failed spectacularly. After drilling 1 and 1/2 hole, it up and died on me. And I was only going through 12\" or so of ice. Only after sitting for a day did it start working again.Granted, this is a very heavy duty application for this drill. It's probably fine for drilling holes using standard bits and whatnot. Just don't use it for drilling holes on the ice. (Or, at least, not using an 8\" bit.)",

This review is more a reflection of the company and those other tools, than this particular tool.Pros:  (1) very fair price for the tools, (2) I use them frequently, and I've never had a problem, (3) very rapid battery charging time, (4) extras provided with most tools, i.e., a carrying bag, a charging unit, and (sometimes) an extra battery, (5) American company (although, due to financial necessity, most of the tools reportedly are manufactured in China and Mexico.)Great job, Porter-Cable.

I do light household projects but I think this drill is capable of much more than I need. I bought this drill because I was looking for a drill and a portable air pump to fill bike tires at the same time and thought of getting two devices that could share batteries. The drill came with 2 batteries and one charger. The only issue I have with this is the battery doesn't last as long as I think it should when using the air pump. I emailed Porter Cable to ask them how to prolong the battery life and got another charger and 2 more batteries in the mail. I am afraid to ask them more questions because I don't want more batteries and chargers, just advice on how to extend the battery life.The charging time on the batteries is very short, less than a half hour for a full charge!",

        "reviewText": "I bought this Dewalt drill after my last plug in model (at least a decade old) was stolen.  Dewalt has done quite a bit to improve their drills since my last purchase.  The adjustable torque is probably the best addition.  It allows you to use less power when necessary on finesse jobs, which makes it much easier to avoid stripping screws (use setting one or two) and drill holes to the proper depth, but the drill will deliver much more power if you need it. The LED light is great too.  It really does illuminate the workspace and eliminates the need to try and juggle a flashlight and power tool at once.  Case is sturdy and allows me to put a screwdriver and drill bit set (21 piece) inside and still get it closed.  Larger sets for commercial use wouldn't fit inside but for a homeowner like myself it's all I will ever need.  Both batteries (comes with two) charged properly and as to date have functioned adequately.  I drill infrequently so I wasn't going to pay more for lithium.  Seems like that would be more of a necessity if I drilled nonstop, like if I worked in construction.The only thing I would improve is add a level back in the rear, which my older, cheaper model had.  It was a great feature and made it easier to drill at a proper angle. I don't understand why Dewalt did away with this feature.  They need to bring it back.If I see any more shortcomings with the product or have any problems with the batteries, I will update my review.  I wish Amazon let us use half stars because I think 4 1/2 stars is spot on for this product.",

        "reviewText": "I've had other smallish portable drills of different brands, and I learned my lesson and am sticking with Black and Decker from now on.  The last portable drill that I had bought (a Durabuilt) stopped working because the battery charger went bad and it turned out that the manufacturer doesn't sell the charger separately -- and they're specialized so you can't use a different charger -- so you have to buy a whole new drill in order to replace the charger!  How insane is that?!  So  I shopped around, read lots of reviews and settled on this B&D GC980, which is also a 9.6 volt model Drill/Drive which I use mostly for the screwdriver function.  I had a stroke many years ago and it's difficult for me to use a screwdriver so these driver drills are very handy for me.This drill probably might not be for someone who doesn't already own a set of drill bits,since it's a very basic drill and comes with one double-ended Phillips/standard screwdriver bit.  But I already had a full set of wood and metal drill bits as well as screwdriver and nutdriver bits left when my Durabuilt POS quit working, and drill/screwdriver bits are pretty inexpensive.I love the light weight of the GC980, and I like the variable speed feature that I can control with the pressure of finger on the trigger.  A nice bonus is the front light that shines directly on whatever I am drilling.  I might have give this drill 5 stars, but the screwdriver bit that comes with it is *very* short (look at the picture!) and it can only be used on screws that are going straight into a flat surface with nothing around around them.  I tried using this to remove a panel of glass from a storm door last week in order to summerize it with the screen panel, and the way this is designed the screwdriver bit wouldn't even reach into the very slightly recessed grooves at the edge of the storm door to remove the screws.  IDK, mayber there are longer screwdriver bits that can be purchased?  I haven't really checked.But overall, the features of this drill outweigh that single drawback.  The light weight, the quick charging battery, the multiple speeds combined with the variable speed trigger all make for a great little drill/driver.  I'd recommend this to anybody who either already has their drill/driver bits as I did or who is planning on buying some.  The value can't be beat.",

Charged batteries, checked out operation, and then did not use for almost 5 months. After driving a dozen or so screws and drilling a few holes - all light duty work - the motor sparked, smoked and died. I drove 25 miles to the nearest authorized service center (Santa Clara CA to Hayward CA). The service center accepted the drill as a warranty return. A few weeks later a replacement was shipped to me. . 2 years later - the drill had not been used much, until recently it was used to drive #8 wood screws. Pilot holes were used (different drill) so the screw driving was relatively light duty work. After driving 65 screws (over several days)- sparks and smoke from the motor - AGAIN! The 2 year warranty is past - but I may be able to make a claim under my credit card warranty extension. BUT - why would I want another replacement drill with such a short lifetime?> I had high hopes for this drill - but I have to absolutely recommend AGAINST buying one.Pros:Batteries hold charge very well - for months ! Much better than NiCad batteries. Compact size, relatively light weight. Torque limits appear to work well. For light work loads - I have found the 1.5 Ah batteries to be adequate. - especially with 2 batteries provided with this product model.Cons:> With only light work loads and short total run times, I have burned out the original drill, and its warranty replacement. One burned out motor is bad luck - getting the random defective product. Two burned out motors is a strong indication of an inferior, poorly designed product.> The chuck takes some getting used to - but it is never really good. This chuck requires two hands for tightening. Many other keyless chucks require only one hand. The chuck is so short, that it is tough to get a grip on it for sufficient tightening.",

If you need just a bit more power turning a screw than what your own handpower can deliver, then you've got the right drill. But if you plan on drilling through any wood harder than pine, thicker than half an inch, or working on a job for longer than 30 minutes then go elsewhere.The drill isn't horrible. It just doesn't quite do what it thinks it can. Also, the studfinder makes an excellent toy for your kids but really isn't something you want to rely on. I tried it and drilled 5 holes where the \"stud\" was only to have the bit go through the drywall and into empty space.The positive here is the price. But again, know what you want to do before you buy this. If you think you just found a screaming deal on an amazing drill, you did not. What you did find is an okay drill that takes care of very small projects -- maybe little crafts where you need holes in popsicle sticks.",

        "reviewText": "My wife bought this drill locally when we got a new house 2 years ago, so it saw a lot of use initially when I had to install all of our blinds/curtains and other misc things to hang around the house.  It was sufficient for all of that.  It was lacking in power for some jobs like when I had to drill through our metal sink with a 1\" hole bit to install a switch for a garbage disposal.  For that it was barely powerful enough to get through the metal without stopping the motor, so I had to use light pressure and let it eat through the metal slowly to get through it.  Same thing when I had to drill a 1\" hole through the back of a desk, it bogged down on the thick/hard wood a lot.So I'm not sure I would recommend this for anything except for normal drywall drilling and screwing things in/out of walls.  The battery completely died and won't hold a charge at all anymore after 2 years either.  So I upgraded to B&D's newer 20v Li-ion drill (B005NNF0YU\u00a0since I already had some of their other 20v tools and their battery packs are interchangeable.  I just now ordered it, so I can't comment for a comparison yet.  You're definitely getting what you pay for here though.Oh, and the stud finder is absolutely useless.  I can put it against pretty much anything and it says there's a stud there.  I recommend getting a mechanical/magnetic one instead.",

Most of the cordless reciprocating saws were much more expensive than this set -- as were many of the corded reciprocating saws. I didn't really need the drill but got the set anyway. I have been quite pleased with both tools. The saw cut a 2-inch tree trunk quickly. It was a little slower to cut a 4X4 fence post, but not annoyingly so. (I bought some Skil pruning blades for this task.) The drill is light weight so I will probably be using it a lot more than I expected.

Black and Decker did a really nice job on the drill driver here. It has plenty if speed and  torke. And the LED lights on your target when the trigger is pressed, which is useful. Haven't had the battery go dead on me yet after hours of regular use.The recip saw works just as well but feels cheap in the hand.

        "reviewText": "I happened on to this drill/driver offer while I was looking for a complete drill/driver package to purchase for a friend at Christmas.  This cost of this bare unit was so low that I couldn't pass it up.  Since I have extra battery packs and chargers on hand, it was a perfect solution.I have the smallest drill/driver that Milwaukee sells; I received it as a \"free gift\" when I bought another tool and figured it would be something else I would cast aside.  However, I very quickly learned that this was the most used tool in my set.  The combination of high power, light weight and small size makes it perfect for so many different tasks.This particular head is a bit larger and offers a standard chuck.  It is more powerful and weighs just a bit more, but works beautifully in those instances where I must use something other than a hex-shank, quick-change bit.  I like these tools and I've never had a moments trouble with them... I do recommend them, particularly for those DIY'ers that need something versatile.  I'm very satisfied.",

        "reviewText": "This is an initial impressions review.If I have any updates or a long term testing notes to add I'll do that in the futtttttture.This little drillmakes our old one we just donated to Goodwill look like a giant beast. I never realized how heaaaaaaaavy the old batteries were. These are so tiny and lightweight they are darn near adorable. (as adorable as rechargeable batteries can be)Our needs for a drill range from art projects to some lightweight home improvement type things and general usage.I recently needed to hang something on the wall of the garage and it was nice to be able to hold the drill up higher without feeling like my wrist was under strain.We have drilled some random holes in scrap wood just for kicks and thrills and to get the feel of the drill. Very nice, powerful. Looking forward to drilling holes for non random reasons now as well!The batteries charge SO fast...I am starting to think our old drill with the big monstrously huge batteries were practically from the stone age. They took forever to charge. These not only came with a nice, usable, launch into a project charge on them but they recharged really quickly.That was what pushed us over the edge of getting a new drill was our old cordless one's batteries were hard to find, expensive, the ones we had no longer would hold a charge and so any time we had a spur of the moment \"let's screw a screw int to that there wall\" urge we had to waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaait. Ugh, cause the old batteries were dead and took ages to charge.These are going to be a joy.Like I mentioned above this is an initials impressions, honeymoon stage of new drill ownership. I will do a long term update down the road a ways.I must admit that I also like having more room on our tool shelf. These batteries or soooo much smaller than our old beast's that I didn't realize how upgrading our drill would mean a little more shelf space (much needed and a nice bonus)This also means the charging area I have set aside in our house for charging batteries is more manageable now as the new charger takes up less space.Pleased with our purchase",

I got this one after researching drills, and learning that cheaper high voltage drills such as 18v, don't actually put out as much voltage as they advertise. I found this to be true, as I noticed this Porter Cable to have significantly more power than my old 18v.The batteries have a long life and fit completely inside the handle, unlike many other cordless drills. It has a bright LED light which I find very convenient. It also has a metal clip on the side, which along with its feather-light weight allows you to hang on the outside of your pocket/belt/etc when working on a project.",

I am female but I have a workshop that I tinker around in and I'm not built like a gorilla. I didn't want a 12v., not strong enough and dies out too quickly. As it turned out Lowes did carry this drill but it wasn't one of the ones on their display so I overlooked it. I purchased mine on Amazon. Doesn't matter, I got the best price at Amazon. Actually, we purchased two. One for drilling and one to drive the screws so not to have to switch bits back and fourth. The last drill(s) I had like this was a Skill that was 14v (this one is 18v). One of them finally died and they don't make it anymore......go figure......anyway, this drill model replaces it NICELY!!!  In my research  what turned me on to this drill is I saw a website that rated the top 10 drills for 2014. They showed a video of it in use and rated it at no.4. Not bad at ALL.",

        "reviewText": "How can you beat? You can't. For $100 you get two li-ion batteries to boot. Maiden voyage I charged both batteries and chucked a 5/8 wood bit and headed for some stumps. Plenty of power in 1 or 2. I was sinking 10\" holes with no trouble in #2. The second stump was maple and hard, indeed the drill had to work much harder but did not stall. After about five holes the drill overheated and shut off. I pushed it too hard and can't fault the drill. In two minutes it came back to life. Protection is likely a good thing, a very good thing. Truthfully drilling as I was would best be done with a cabled more heavy duty unit, not this drill. Still, had I moved more slowly this drill would easily do the job.Given B&D owns DeWalt I'd guess this drill has similar internal engineering, probably that of the well more expensive DeWalt from a previous production. I've used the DeWalt and they are good stuff, nice smooth chucks, but this B&D appears to be the far better value. Chucks are the seeming weak point. If this one lasts as well as my last B&D 24 volt I'll be a continued customer. At some point you need a plug-in model, this drill is capable for all the rest. Why spend more other than to impress people with a different color model.",

I've been using a corded Black and Decker drill for years as I tried a cordless non-BandD drill you find at your nearest home improvement store that didn't last more than a year.This thing has the high power necessary for drilling through thicker metal (I've even used it to drill through steel on a PC case's frame) and adjustable power necessary for driving screws.  It has good weight to that makes for even pressure.The fact that it comes with two batteries is great and a must.  The batteries is where it seems the companies like to cash in if you don't buy them up front.  A single battery, on its own, costs nearly the same amount as this set.  My advice?  Get this set with two batteries.It's really a great drill that has all the power I'll need for any home project.",

I already have the yard tools hedger, trimmer and blower along with the speed charger and several batteries and one flashlight.  Along with these products, I purchased the multi tool, sander, jig saw, and little circular saw. I am into this later group of tools (not including the garden tools and speed charger) for about $140.  The light is amazing. It's very adjustable, bright, and lasts for a very long time. I have not used the little tools much at this point but they slide on and off well and seem to be very well built and functional as long as the base tool holds up. If it doesn't, I will write back and change my review.  I own all these tools individually and I am doing a major remodel, I will bring all the actual separate tools for the job and not put too many hours on these tools.  The thing I like most about these tools is that they seem to be well built and don't take up much space, so if I think I might need them I can throw the bag (where I keep them) in the back of the car and have many options taking up very little space. I own rental properties and do a substantial amount of work on them myself.  It makes me crazy when I need a tool that I don't have with me. With this set of tools, I have many options all in a convenient, small, and inexpensive package.  If you are concerned about price, this stuff does go on sale and current price is less than amazing.",

I use them everyday for cabinet assembly and installation.  I recently purchased three of the DCD790B brushless drills.  They seemed to be just as nice as the 780's, until I used them for the first time.  The drill will shut down after a second or two when running at low speeds and under a load.  This happens every time I install longer screws.  It does fine until the screw is almost in and it shuts down.  The 780 will also do this, but after a much longer period of time.  It is a safety feature designed to protect the motor and battery form overheating.  If I can't use the drill, it really isn't worth having.  I am returning all three and purchasing more of the 780's.",

        "reviewText": "I bought this drill after purchasing and extensively using the 20V DeWalt reciprocating saw.  While it will no doubt prove extremely useful around our house, I really got it to be a companion to the sawz-all that I use outside to cut down and kill invasive vegetation.  Southwest Florida has an over-abundance of Brazilian Pepper trees, Malelucas, Jamaican Apples, and Kudzu.  In addition several types of fast-growing palms with dangerous spikes also present a problem.Rather than use a chain saw in the thick brush that I have to work in, I bought some large tooth saw blades for the reciprocating saw and use it to trim and cut down the invasives.  The larger trees with extensive root systems pose a grow-back problem, so now I use the DeWalt drill (with a long thick blade) to drill a downward slanting hole into the heart of the tree to be eliminated.  Once the hole is drilled, Iput a funnel in it and pour in a sizeable amount of Round Up concentrate or similar strength brush killer.  If there are multiple trunks, I treat each trunk.  It takes a while to be effective but the results are well worth the effort. It sure beats having to cut everything down to the ground and keep up with the regrowth.The 20V batteries I use in the sawz-all of course also work perfectly in the drill.  I find that I get about sixty minutes of charge from each battery so I keep one in the charger while using the other one.  Battery technology has come a long way in the last 20 years.",

        "reviewText": "For only being a 12 volt drill, it has a lot of torque.  Also, what made me choose the Black and Decker is the reasonably priced battery replacement cost.  Years ago, I purchached a Makita combo at Costco.  It was a 14.4 volt NiMH battery unit that also had a flashlight (not like some of the combos now that have a saw, sander drill and flashlight) for $150 or so.  When the batteries wouldn't take a charge anymor I priced them and the cheapest one I could fine was $90!  For one battery.  This whole drill only cost $50!  The Li ion battery has a long shelf life, which was another draw back to cordless tools: when you need them, you have to wait till you charge them up.  The Li ion is much better at holding a charge between uses than the Ni cad or NiMH batteries.  After the Makita, I tried an 18 volt from Harbor Freight.  It was strong, but heavy.  And the same problem of never being charged when you needed it applied with the H/F drill.  Then I got this B&D one.  The other big plus is that when I need to replace the battery, they are only $30!  So, for use in garage and household projects, I highly recommend this light weight, but high torque B&D 12 volt Li ion drill.  For constant use, like construction jobs, I would not recommend this lower power, light weight drill.",

It fit nicely in my hand, it is a lighter weight than the larger drills, but has enough heft to feel like a quality tool.  This drill is pretty much the same, and is a lot less expensive.  The only differences that I've noticed so far is that it doesn't have a light, and it doesn't use the quick change bits (which I actually prefer, because they are cheaper and easier to find).  I'm sure that it wouldn't hold up as long side by side to the Milwaukee, but for household tasks, it is perfect!",

        "reviewText": "Very compact, and being a 12v drill it is quite capable of most things i use a drill for. I use this at my hotel maintainance job (very large hotel) and with exception of a corkscrew boring bit and stirring paint, (for that i use a 12 amp 110v 1/2\" right-angle drill) this is the only drill i use. The battery looks small, but the Li-Ion chemistry makes it a very long lasting battery. I find that i charge two batteries on the weekend and they easily last through the entire work week. The batteries charge very fast, which means if i do run one battery dead, the other one is ready again before i need it.  I also love the fact that Li-Ion batteries don't have to be dead to be charged, so i can top them off each weekend even if they don't need it. The older chemistry in Ni-Cad and NiMH batteries aren't this tolerant to redundant charging. It fit very nicely into my 12\" tool bag that i run the hallways with. I find that this drill compares very well with the traditional full sized 12v drills with the clunky Ni-Cad or NiMH battery, both in power and in battery capacity. The built in battery meter is very easy to read, works great. Some battery meters don't correspond to actual run-time but this one seems to. (i think the Li-Ion chemistry is the reason for it being greatly more accurate) The carrying case fits everything nicely, and seems very durable. There is a flap at the bottom with some hard brittle cardboard in it, and it crumbles easily, but it doesn't dump crumbs out and doesn't seem to affect anything. (i cut a slit in the end of the flap and replaced this cardboard with a plastic strip and melted the slit shut but didn't really need to)My only issue with this product is that so far i'm unable to find other Skil tools i need that use the same battery. (but i haven't given up looking) Regardless, i'm still completely satisfied with this product.",

I bought it for sixty with two batteries at Menards - so I can't complain much and give it three stars. It does not seem to be much different from other expensive brands, except for two major cons listed below.CONS:1. Very, I mean VERY, uncomfortable trigger: too wide and square in shape with sharp edges. You can actually see it on the Amazon product picture. The trigger will hurt one's finger badly if one would work long hours with it. It does not matter if one's hands are large or small, it will hurt after a while. Consider gloves or some sort of glue-on padding on the trigger.2. No LED light in front to light up the work area. That light is pretty standard in every Li-Ion drill and it is convenient. This drill does not have it. Hoewever it has a battery charge indicator with three blue LEDs. I would gladly trade it for a light in front.OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:As I mentioned earlier, the drill and its batteries do not seem to be any different from other \"major brands\", it is all made in China, like all others. I might take it apart and fit it with a white LED in front taking power from the first LED in the battery indicator.",

You wouldn't want to chuck up a 3\" hole saw in this tool, but I am really impressed with the level of performance vs. the size and price.  Instead of using it as a secondary option, it has become my primary option moving my 18V to the number 2 choice.2 batteries is also a must have.  They seem to have enough capacity to keep me going.  No more having to wait for the charger to juice the next one up.  There are a couple of more expensive options available that have a slight edge (Bosch and Milwaukee), but I don't see the need to shell out more cash when this unit does the trick.",

        "reviewText": "I've had another brand of drill/driver for years, and because the old one uses the old style nickel-cadmium battery,  I thought it was time to upgrade to a Lithium device, because generally, Lithium batteries put out more power, giving more torque and also a longer battery life.  In addition, they usually recharge faster.  And, it's just nice to have TWO battery powered devices.  This came in real handy when I was putting up a new fence.  I used the old drill/driver with a drill in it to drill the holes to attach the cedar slates to the fence rails, and the new drill/driver to screw in the screws on the followup pass.  Time savings is not having to switch out drills and bits.  Sure, it's fast with these, but hey, I'm one lazy dude!In any case, it all went perfectly, the new fence looks very nice and the Bosch was integral in getting the job done quickly.  I did one 85' run of fence, four screws per board (2 up, 2 down) and did it all on a single charge!  (close to 200 boards)",

I used it just for misc home projects, so lightweight usage, no construction projects, ie deck buildings etc.  I was always a bit disappointed in the batteries draining when not in use, so with my light usage, almost always had to recharge the battery before I use.  I dealt with, I have had other cordless power tools that weren't much better.After maybe 5 years or so of this light usage, was using the drill to attach a bottle cleaner to (a few straps of cloth on a long rod you put into a bottle to clean it, no torque or force used during operations, just spins freely), and started smelling something frying.  A few seconds later the puff of smoke and flames./sparks shooting out the casing.  The unit was never dropped or abused beyond typical tool use.  Everyone gives it great reviews, and I would have been happy with it (a 4 star product) but I have to remove two stars for bursting into flames.  Only thing keeping it from one star is I did have it about 5 years, but for the price/usage that seems too short, I have much older tools still going strong.  So now I have two mediocre batteries and a charger sitting around, also have a few unused Bosch 18v batteries, so gonna try the Bosch Cordless drill next, love all my other Bosch tools, none have caught on fire.",

        "reviewText": "Obviously this drill has it's purposes. I typically use it install electrical and small projects. It's a good tool to have in tight spaces. The battery is pretty good. It isn't as light as I thought it would be, which is why I bought it. I would not use it to screw a lot of large wood screws unless the hole is pre-drilled.Unfortunately, it broke, after about 7 months of occasional light use. The drill direction switch broke. It only goes into reverse. I took it apart and there are 2 small tabs that control the direction switch. One of the tabs snapped off. I contacted Mikita and luckily the service center isn't that far away. I didn't have a receipt but there is a date code on the drill. So they will take it back. It will take about a week until I should get it back.Update:Finally dropped off the drill at a service center. It took less than 3 minutes. I asked the service guy if this was a common problem and he said it happens. I asked him if it will happen again and he said it likely won't but not with too much confidence. Anyway, he will have it fixed in a day or so and mail it back to me. Overall I am happy with Mikita. I will rate it 4 stars only because it shouldn't have broken in the first place.",

The only time I actually broke one of these was when it fell off the roof of my van, (Don't ask!) and that was my own fault.  The drill shattered but the battery was still intact, so I ordered another drill and now I have an additional spare battery.  Aside from my previously mentioned incident, the only problem I've ever experienced with these is the forward/reverse button breaking off on one side.  I was still able to use the drill as it was until I used super glue to reattach the button.  Admittedly, even this was due to the way they were being used and stored in the truck, NOT a flaw in the tool.  For the price...you can't beat these.",

Skil gave me a new one after I told them I'd take my story to Amazon product reviews.  3 months later it, too, died after little use, and yes, I did store batteries outside the drill when not in use.

I'm a professional (or at least want to be seen as one). I need to have nothing less than an 18 volt tool hanging from my belt.Well, think again. Power is not the only consideration, and neither is size. For the longest time I have always thought that way, but this tool changed all that.I already have a Ryobi 18 volt impact driver, but as one might imagine, it is a lot bigger than this Hitatchi. For others out there, the thought \"Oh, let me get another tool that is smaller and less powerful that the one I already own\" may never cross your mind, but consider this:Two days after I took delivery of this product, my car developed a horrid squealing noise. Being the weekend warrior (in my situation, thats code for a frugal tight-fisted individual), I googled the situation and found a video on how to take care of it.To execute the remedy, I was required to lie on my back in the floor space in front of the front passenger seat in the car with my legs sticking out of the car, and work in an incredibly confined space up under the dashboard. When I saw the spot I was going to have to work in, I instantly knew that the larger Ryobi 18 volt impact driver would never fit and it was the perfect opportunity to try the Hitatchi.Not only did the Hitatchi make an easy job of undoing nuts that had never been opened since the car was made (some 10 years ago), but it was the perfect size to allow the driver with the attachment to reach the nuts. It delivers mad power,The icing on the cake is the little LED that illuminates the task at hand so you don't have to use your cell phone or something else to see what you are doing in confined dark places.If you already have an impact driver, it might not be suitable for every application. Having this as a Plan B is a great idea.ProsMad power - this thing is virtually unstoppable.Size - it is smaller and therefore more suitable for a wider range of tasks than larger tools.LED light - pressing the trigger will engage the LED light prior to the driver spinning up.Belt clip - easy to stash the tool on your belt or on your jeansTwo batteries - no need to explain that oneConsNA",

I also own a Milwaukee 18v impact driver that weighs more than the Hitachi model, and while it is more powerful, the difference is negligible in real-world applications. Also, the Milwaukee 18v battery doesn't seem to last as long as the one that powers the Hitachi driver.

        "reviewText": "The Hitachi cordless driver drill includes a few helpful features that another small drill I own does not have.  First, the kit comes with a second battery.  Although Lithium-Ion batteries last a long time on a full charge, when they do go out, they drop off rapidly, so it's great to have a second fully charged one ready for an extended job.  Second, it is really helpful to have a clutch on a small driver drill when you're driving screws in a tight space barely big enough to get fingers near, a clutch can insure consistent torque and may prevent over-driving a screw when you can't really see what you're doing, even with the help of the convenient included work light (which should be placed closer to the top of the handle so it shines directly onto the workpiece).  I found myself up on a ladder attaching some trim high over my head on our back fence.  I probably would have pushed too hard and maybe dropped the screw without the consistent torque.  This project brings up the third helpful feature.  It's that included belt loop.  When last I tried a project along this fence, I dropped my hand clippers over to the neighboring property.  I could hang this driver drill onto a hook each time I wanted to make an adjustment.  The small size (6.75\" length, plus whatever bit you add) and light weight (just under 2.5 lb including the battery), make this a great option for repairs and home projects.  Its small diameter allowed me to reattach a strip of trim to a cabinet with a thin screw that is only about an inch above the floor.  When I originally attached this trim, I had to use a multi-tool (Dremel) which involved a cord, and was quite inconvenient.The kit comes with a carrying case, the second battery and charger, and a set of bits, which are all enclosed in a decent carrying case with room for some drill bits (not included).",

It is very powerful for its size for a while but doesn't last as long as larger drills with bigger and stronger batteries.  It has it's place around the house drilling smaller holes or installing or removing screws and will fit into spots where some larger cordless drills won't.  The LED light isn't very bright or positioned where I would want it but it does provide some illumination to help line up the drill bit before you start drilling.There is a belt loop that can be attached to either side of the drill depending upon your needs.I like the feel in my hand and the balance it pretty good.  It is much lighter than my 18V Bosch Drill Hammer that costs way more money and does a lot of the same jobs around the house.I like that everything comes in a storage case but the case isn't form-fitted as I would prefer (but I'm nit picking).  The steel bits that are included are okay but as I said earlier, I replaced min with high-quality impact driver bits.There is a 2 year warranty on the batteries and a lifetime warranty on the drill.I think Hitachi did a very good job filling a niche with this highly-capable drill that falls firmly in the middle of the market.",

The drill has a solid feel that can be used as an every day tool and has a good amount of torque for a 12 volt - 300 in lbs which is impressive...the standard Milwaukee Drill has 275 in lbs and the Fuel has 350 in lbs but you are paying 50 bucks more for it too. The clutch has 21 settings and a drill setting and a 3/8 chuck. There are 3 things I'm going to nitpick on: The LED light to show you where you are drilling is dim and it's down around the battery pack, it needs to be brighter up near the chuck and more focused, there is no battery level indicator, most brands don't have it except for Milwaukee but they've spoiled me and I now it's hard to live without it and the last is the battery design, it's clunky for a 12 volt. it should of been designed to either be out of the way like most 12 volt drills or have a slightly lower flatter base battery so the drill can stand the drill upright.  One little bit of deceptive advertising is that the package says \"lithium tool lifetime warranty\" but that doesn't include batteries they are only 2 years which isn't bad but the package makes it sort of sound like everything is warrantied.  Overall I like this drill except for the small details I've mentioned. The problem is that Milwaukee and Makita are setting the bar high on what a 12 volt power tool should be and the Hitachi doesn't meet those standards maybe it would've 5 years ago but not now.",

The batteries and charging station for their 12v line is not only super expensive, it is extremely troublesome and lacks quality. Because I invested a lot of money on Milwaukee products initially, it didn't make sense for me to switch brands. But I had to spend a lot of extra money to get a stable set that worked and charged reliably. As a result I completely regret going with Milwaukee. If you are considering a cordless drill set, do yourself a favor and go with a Bosch, Makita or a Porter Cable. Heck even a cheapo Ryobi, Black & Decker or Kawasaki is better. Go with something else and you'll be much happier.",

I already had a Milwaukee saws all with batteries so just use the same ones for this drill. I have used it for mixing tile mastic and it performed well, guessing it's really not meant for anything that heavy but did ok.Really like the smaller/lighter size.",

So I didn't need/want the batteries or charger for this tool.Yes it came in a plastic ziplock, and was packed with 6 very heavy Pony clamps and some brown paper. Needless to say the clamps probably hammerd the drill but I could see any damage and it works great.Pros:The trigger pressure is very nice allows easy speed controlThe drive is locked when no power so bit or drill changes are a snap with the keyless chuckThe LED light is nice and bright with no shadows. I even drove a pocket screw at 11PM on a dimly lit porch and had no issues seeingThe battery meter is niceThe 21 position chuck is sweet, now I can use this when my Ikea cabinets arrive and not worry about over driving the hundreds of screws that awaitThe over molding protects the drill from damage and a grippy hand feelThe price of the bare tool is a great dealCons:It's brushed motor and at full tilt you can see the sparks (and thus the brushes) wearing away.

Lightweight, tons of torque, the light is great, controls are placed well and I like the idea of a lifetime warranty on the batteries.  I've been using this drill in combination with my 18v Dewalt and I find myself grabbing for the Rockwell more than the big unit.The only gripes are - make sure you tighten the chuck in the low-speed setting.  If you tighten it on \"2\" it can slip later, but tighten in on \"1\" and it's great.  Also if it had a belt clip that'd be a nice addition.  The drill is so light you could just hang it on your belt and it wouldn't be obnoxious.Great unit so far!",

These do not replace heavier-duty tools that have cords (my corded drill is a DeWalt) but are great for those small jobs around the house & yard where extension cords are a pain to use.  I already have the work light, which I use as a flashlight next to my bed and really like the smaller 12-volt battery.  The charger I got with the work light is the one that can charge both the 12- and 20-volt (DCB101), which gives me great options.  The charger with this pack only charges 12-volt, so it got donated.I would recommend also purchasing the work light for many functions but for my purposes it lasts months as an emergency light kept around the house.  Great not having to replace AA or D batteries (I originally had a huge Maglite D-flashlight, but the DeWalt light focuses the light better, is easier to turn off and on and is more comfortable to hold).",

It is one of the few one-handed saws that is both lightweight and adjustable.When trimming tree branches you need a one handed saw because the other hand needs to support the branch so it does not crack and split. If you are only using it to trim branches then don't waste your money on a blade kit like I did, just get the 9\" pruning blade and be done with it. The only negative is the battery life is short - about 10 minutes of constant cutting of dry branch wood. I intend on getting the extended battery and will report back after a few work sessions.",

That battery does lead to a heavier drill overall so it's not nearly as portable but it manages a great deal of torque.The only downsides are a large one and a small one. The head no longer pivots at a 45 degree angle. This isn't huge but there were some few instances where space was tight and this was the best angle to attack the screw. Well, no longer. The other tiny detail is that the well that holds the bit when in storage is super hard to get the bit in and out of. That being said, it's good to know it will never fall out.",

I was also pleased with its capacity to handle the 18v batteries (I have three).

        "reviewText": "For only being a 12 volt drill, it has a lot of torque.  Also, what made me choose the Black and Decker is the reasonably priced battery replacement cost.  Years ago, I purchached a Makita combo at Costco.  It was a 14.4 volt NiMH battery unit that also had a flashlight (not like some of the combos now that have a saw, sander drill and flashlight) for $150 or so.  When the batteries wouldn't take a charge anymor I priced them and the cheapest one I could fine was $90!  For one battery.  This whole drill only cost $50!  The Li ion battery has a long shelf life, which was another draw back to cordless tools: when you need them, you have to wait till you charge them up.  The Li ion is much better at holding a charge between uses than the Ni cad or NiMH batteries.  After the Makita, I tried an 18 volt from Harbor Freight.  It was strong, but heavy.  And the same problem of never being charged when you needed it applied with the H/F drill.  Then I got this B&D one.  The other big plus is that when I need to replace the battery, they are only $30!  So, for use in garage and household projects, I highly recommend this light weight, but high torque B&D 12 volt Li ion drill.  For constant use, like construction jobs, I would not recommend this lower power, light weight drill.",

It will hold the tool, the stud finder, and even a box of drill bits or other small knick-knacks quite nicely  The drill is great for things like assembling furniture or hanging pictures and the like.  It is not strong enough though for continued heavy use.  I was doing some light carpentry work on my deck that required drilling 2 1/2\" screws into dry wood.  It couldn't do this for long before it lost the ability to drive the screw more than halfway in.  I later bought a DeWalt drill (corded) for around $60 and the power difference left me speechless.  I would describe this as an \"apartment grade\" vs. professional or even residential grade drill.  I lost the convenience of the battery pack but I got the job done.The stud finder is marginal at best.  It does not find the center of the stud but rather the edge of the stud so you need to approach from both edges of the stud, make a mental or note or small mark, and choose the center between the two marks.  Clumsy at best but who is complaining at this price point.  If you only have light or small amounts of medium duty work then this drill is a nice purchase for the money.  Don't buy it for the stud finder though.",

        "reviewText": "I probably should have done a little bit more research before making this somewhat unplanned purchase.  My current 14.4v Black & Decker drill that I purchased several years ago seems to be on the way out.  It started smoking but interestingly still works.  However, I decided to buy a new one and found this \"deal\" on Amazon.  My old 14.4v B&D drill was in the same price range and had a separate battery charger, a built in Battery charge level lights, and lights that indicated when you were drilling straight down (a built in plumb so to speak).  This drill has none of that.  I can live without the plumb lights, but the battery level light was helpful as was the separate charger configuration.This drill does however come with a separate stud finder tool that runs on 2 AA batteries.  I already have one of these stud finder tools.  I'm not sure why B&D would throw this separate tool in with the drill other than as a marketing thing.  I'm buying a drill and would rather have better quality, functionality, etc. in the drill itself.  If I need a stud finder, I would buy one separately.To charge the battery in this drill, the battery is left in the drill and the transformer plug in plugged directly into the back of the drills handle (lower rear of the handle just above where the battery snaps in).  To me this seems somewhat awkward.  I would rather snap out the battery pack and snap the battery into a separate charger unit.  With this drill, it does not seem one would be able to use the drill while also charging the battery, unless one purchased a separate charger and of course a second battery.This drill does use the B&D 14.4v HPB14 battery pack that does snap out of bottom of the drill handle.When I compare my prior similar B&D drill, this drill seems to look \"cheaper\" in terms of the orange plastic.  It does not look rugged when compared to other cordless drills I have seen.  However, this may simply be aesthetic and preference.This drill does have a rubberized area on the back side of the handle (the dark grey / black area of the back of the drill handle).  The trigger does not seem to be rubberized (or softer) just plastic.The drill comes with a zip up black bag that is nothing special and seems light weight.  My old B&D drill came in a rugged hard shell black plastic case.  I may be able to modify my old B&D drills case (rip out some of the interior plastic) to accommodate this drill.  I should also be able to use the charger and battery from my old drill on this new drill.  Indeed my older B&D 14.4v battery does run this new drill.There is a drill bit holder (for an extra bit), but in my opinion it is awkwardly located on top of the front where the battery pack snaps in (Just below where your pinky finger would be when holding the drill).  When a drill bit is snapped into this holder, the bit sticks out and is in an awkward location.  I could see myself gouging myself with this configuration.  My old B&D drill had the drill bit holder on the right side just above where the battery pack snaps in and the bit holder was also recessed into the plastic and not sticking out.  Ouch!",

I was spoiled by the ultra-light weight of the 7-volt, but I had to pre-drill holes to get a screw into pressure-treated wood. I've had a few weeks to see what this 14-volt B&D can do and I am satisfied. To my mind, it compares favorably in power with many 18-volt drills. Wood screws go right in without a fight.Comes with one short dual-head bit to get you started. Stud sensor was a nice bonus, but not essential to me. You may have to replace bag if you use it a lot.Price was competitive for this complete kit.",

This is a great screwdriver/drill kit that is lightweight, stays charged long and does a good job on the variable speed when you need to go slow.  I haven't needed to use it for heavy duty use yet, but I can definitely recommend it for anyone who wants to use it around the house or for similar work to what I've described.  The weight is balanced well, and despite the size of the battery the unit feels decently light weight.An upside to this model is that you can charge it while leaving the battery on. The previous model I bought and own personally of the same brand requires me to take the battery off to charge it on a plastic charging base.  I prefer this one.I haven't used the stud finder enough to review that, but I'll update in the future once I feel I've used it enough.",

I'm not a \"tool junkie\" who just has to have the latest and flashiest tools to impress my buddies.I had previously upgraded my cordless drill to a Bosch HDS 18V hammer drill, primarily because it came packed in a Bosch L-Boxx, which I wanted to try.  That system came with two batteries and a charger, plus the L-Boxx is a bit oversized.  When I saw this bare drill prices as cheaply as it is, I saw an opportunity.Instead of having to switch between drill bit ( to predrill my holes) and the screw driver bit, I can now chuck-up one of each.  A time saver when doing lots of holes in finish-sensitive surfaces.I now don't have a spare battery, but since each drill is doing half the work the batteries hold charge twice as long.  And by doing a custom foam insert in the L-Boxx, I can accommodate both drill (plus charger and bits) in one box.I've owned, and used others', drills made by many manufacturers.  I can find no fault with these Bosch units.  I must confess I bought this one thinking is was the same as my HDS, only to find it lacks the hammer drill function.  No loss to me, as any serious hammer drilling is done by me with a HD corded drill.I've read other reviews claiming the Bosch chucks are eccentric.  All I can say to that is check the way you've chucked the bit.  I suspect it's more a case of user error.Nice package, right price.",

        "reviewText": "I bought a model similar to this in 2000. I used a cordless drill for work back then, and I worked the snot out of it. This drill handled most anything I put it through, but there was constant re-charging. It was all well for the first year, as the batteries would last nearly as long as it took the spare battery to charge. Even if the spare wasn't fully charged, it was mostly charged and I had plenty of work time in it.After about a year the batteries didn't last quite as long, but still long enough to where I was never waiting on a battery. After two years, I had to take 10 minute breaks a couple of times a day for the batteries to catch up. Still not too bad. I was doing residential electrical work so a drill saw the majority of the work out of my power tool line up. So much so that I honestly believed that 2 years of service life is asking alot of a cordless drill (I still do). At any rate, the drill worked but the batteries didn't hold a great charge when I got out of electrical work. The drill lasted another 11 years doing DIY around-the-house duty. One battery crapped out a little over a year ago... wouldn't charge. The remaining battery lasts maybe 10 minutes of hard use on a full charge.The chuck on the XP model I purchased (I assume that is similar to the XRP I'm reviewing) was good to go. It's a half inch metal chuck that never gave me any problems. Apparently they use a different one that comes loose after repeated stops and starts these days, according to reviews. I never had that problem. I did have two of the non-XP drills with a 3/8ths inch chuck. The chuck fell apart after a months worth of commercial use and the batteries were worthless after 6 months... don't waste your time. At any rate, from everything I've read the new Li-ion technology is where it's at. This drill is still worth the money, I think. I bought a B&D Li-ion to replace my dead DeWalt... mostly because my tools see rather light use these days. If I were to use my tools professionally, though, this is probably what I would buy.",

The first got the high torque gear busted for over use in drilling through Many 2x4 for electric work. Still I find this model an excellent tool for the trade. I had to write a review, this product deserves to be recognized as the prime tool it is.Actually this is my third 14.4volt DeWalt driver in ten years, the first was a different model.I know how to use my tools and how NOT to abuse them, and I still prefer this system.",

Funny the next day he dropped it off my boat - 12ft down in salt water for 30 minutes.  Rises it in fresh water then with rubbing alcohol and let it dry.  The drill and battery both work.  The battery gets a little warm on the charge because of the salt water corrosion, but it still works.",

        "reviewText": "I first bought the hex driver and I like it so well that I bought the impact driver and I like it also, so I came back for the drill. It was sort-of a no brainier to add this to my 12 volt Makita tool collection, because I already had 3 batteries and a charger that fit and thats enough for a homeowner/DIY'er like me. I have a full set of 18 volt tools for the heavy jobs, but for +90% of my jobs I find that these work a lot better, because they are not too big and bulky (i.e. the 18 volt stuff is an over-kill for most jobs). Why did I go Makita rather than some other brand?  Because Makita has a good package on their 12 volt tools just like the other top name brand stuff, but the Makita does have 2 items that is implemented better than the hit-or-miss on some of the other brands and they are: the after-glow light (i.e. not just an on/off light) and the RPM on the hex driver and drill start real slow when you pull the trigger (not like some of the others that cause the bit/drill bit to spin out of position when you startup). All in all I'm happy with these Makita tools, but I know that tools are like cars; there's the Ford, Chevy, Toyota and etc. race out there, but this is IMHO so take it for what's it is worth!",

This is my favorite drill. I read the reviews carefully and did extensive research. Having owned several Ni-Cads, and promising myself I wouldn't buy another, I found this B&D drill. Was a little concerned about reviews complaining of loose chucks - I have not had this problem. The clutch works perfectly and prevents wallowing out wood screws when assembling furniture. Positive power and drill brake works exceptionally. I will use this drill today with my Kreg Jig for making several pocket holes and have confidence it will perform superbly.Couldn't be more please for the price! Excellent purchase!",

This results in the hole being larger vs. needed and can cause screw or fitment issues.I've seen two of these drills do this now and seems to run in the line. It's hard to see unless you have a good eye but powering the tool at low speed with slight trigger and watching the chuck shows it as does putting a long drill bit wen you see the end wobbling all over.I've also seen inconstancy on the LED power. I own another one of these and the LED is about 3x brighter vs. this one was. It also had a stronger motor that seemed to provide more tq. despite both being the exact same model number just built a year apart.If you can get this for $40 bucks sure do it, but not worth any more with these flaws. A drill needs to not wobble. Never had these problems with DEWALT drills.",

It is not as durable as dewalt or some of the other manufacturers but it works for light duty stuff. You are not paying for the name, just the tool. I you were to drop this or it fell from a ladder on accident, I am pretty sure you will have to buy a new one.

There's a few that have a bit more power or torque or a little more run time, but as far as tough and reliable Makitas are hard to beat! This little 12v driver is just another good example of that. I've went through and killed 2 milwakuee 12vs and one Bosch in less then a year and the 2yr old Makita that's got the most use and worst treatment is the only one still running and like it was new (deffinetly don't look new).

Power density in Lithium-ion battery is much more than nicads, means less weight for same run time. Son is in the Closet Crafter business, he now has 8 of these. Do NOT leave battery out in the cold in the winter. Doesn't hurt it, just does not put out when cold.",

It was perfect cuz its a small enough to go where i need it, and still powerful enough to get through a firewall without too much effort.  However one day it just stopped working.  no warning, no buzzing, no smoke - Just stopped turning.  The light comes on when I pull the trigger but nothing else happens.  After talking to some people this is not all that uncommon for these drills.  Apparently its a faulty 'transmission'.  Everbody got a good laugh that Im the only guy in my shop who didnt get the $20 warranty on it.",

I just got this to replace my 10 year old Black & Decker (B&D) 12V Firestorm which still works great but I'm tired of always charging the dying old NiCad batteries that don't last very long. I was way overdue for a Lithium Ion driver and I finally settled on this.  At this price point nothing touches it but I really wish I could leave it half a star less and I'll get into that in a bit. This is all the drill you should should ever need around your home and I'm fine with that. It has all the features of the more expensive brands I was looking at in the $100 price range such as the entry level Makita and Bosch cordless drills but at half the price. What's the difference? You won't see B&D products on a jobsite laboring day in and day out.CONS: Why do I wish there was a 3.5 star option? The body of the drill is a cheap plastic that looks like it's toy grade and there's no carrying/storage case included.PROS: Good value at this price point and compatibility of the battery with a good selection of other affordable, readily available B&D products such as their string trimmer, hedge clippers, leaf blower, etc.It was really the compatibility of the battery with the other B&D tools that tilted me in favor to buy this as a homeowner. The other brands I was looking at don't make any other cordless products I would buy or easily afford. Ryobi is a great alternative too for the same reason but I went with B&D since I can find their products in many more stores including here on Amazon while Ryobi means a trip down to Home Depot where they also carry B&D. This a great, small and powerful drill at the end of the day as long as your livelihood doesn't depend on it. I had to be honest with myself and accept that this will serve me well around the house as my 10 year old B&D (pictured for comparison) since 95% of my tasks are light duty like hanging a picture frame or assembling Ikea furniture.",

I've been using the B&D now for quite some time and find it to be a fantastic tool for most jobs around the house.  It holds a charge for really long and has enough power to drive some serious screws into wood.  It is well balanced and light enough to use in areas above the head and shoulders.  If you are looking for a drill/driver for multiple uses then this is a great choice, expecially for the price.",

This was returned to Amazon unused, for full credit, however, I did purchase the exact item and review it below.The drill is as described for performance on all levels.  As a professional metal fab person in the past I have used such quality products for many years.  I had never used this brand before but it certainly would be one I would not hesitate to use for professional use!It is very powerful, and the battery life is exceptional.  It is wonderful to have it ship with two batteries so one is always on the charger should you need a fresh battery.  Many require you purchase a second battery and they are very expensive as stand alone items.Highly recommend this for the home owner as well as those who make a living needing a quality tool.",

        "reviewText": "Craftsman 9-1430 Nextec 12-Volt Cordless Drill/Driver:I have several different 12-Volt power tools that I use and are powered by the Nextec 12-Volt Lithium-Ion Cordless System.  Craftsman has been running sales on these tools since this Summer when I bought this drill/driver. Craftsman uses the powered by Die-Hard proprietary name and this tool carries the UL-listed logo.  The drill/driver is Made in China, but the product is distributed in the United States by Sears Brands Management Corporation Hoffman Estates, Illinois. The Craftsman Nextec 12-Volt Lithium-Ion Drill Driver is lightweight, compact, and great for light to moderate DIY work. I've been using it over the last several months and thoroughly pleased with it.  Holds a long charge, is solidly built and easy to hold and handle.I use this drill/drive a lot around the house.  Why, you say?  Well, for starters it is very lightweight and fits in your hand very easily and it has an LED light that illuminates your working area and the chuck is a quick-connect for easy bit changes.  The thumb activated directional switch and a little resistance from your other hand on the chuck and the bit is secured or loosened very quickly. This is a 3/8-Inch drill/driver with 195 in.-lbs. of torque. Craftsman NEXTEC 12-volt add-on tool. Add-on tool does not include battery or charger. NEXTEC-ergonomically designed and engineered with advanced features, portability and power to meet the challenging demands of the next generation of Do-It-Yourselfers. Includes: Drill/driver only. So, having an extra battery would be advisable if you are using this tool for long and heavy use.  This will enable you to complete the job by switching out the battery when needed.I've stated that I have several tools using this battery system and they are all very well-engineered and lightweight but carry very good torque for getting the job done.  The integrated battery design gives these tools an improved balance and ergonomics.  Also, the Lithium-Ion technology delivers lighter weight and better battery performance and longer shelf life.  The turn around time on the quick charger is 30-Minutes. There is enhanced grip while using this drill/driver giving you greater accuracy while using. The batteries are easily swapped and they charge extremely fast and last longer than the old heavy Ni-cad batteries, and the best part is, if you need one fast and can't wait to get one from Amazon, you can run down to the local Sears and grab one at a decent priceCraftsman offers a one year limited warranty:  For one year from the date of purchase, thus power tool, battery pack and charger are warranted against any defects in material or workmanship.  With proof of purchase, defective product(s) will be replaced free of charge.  For warranty coverage details to obtain free replacement, visit the Craftsman web site.  The warranty does not cover nut driver bits or screwdriver bits, which are expendable parts that can wear out from normal use within the warranty period.  Make sure that you read the full disclosure on their web site.Nextec products have been ergonomically designed and engineered by Craftsman to meet the high demands of the next generation of Do-It-Yourselfers.  Craftsman has built the most advanced features, portability and power into every quality NEXTEC product so that you can accomplish even the most challenging projects with confidence.  It doesn't bog down with tough drilling or driver jobs and stays powerful on a long charge.  It has a real solid feel to it, yet it's not excessively heavy or hard to handle at all.When using battery technology it is wise to consider recycling the spent battery.  The manual with this product gives guidance on the proper disposal and recycling of the battery, when the time comes.Driving bits:  The ones that I use...Wera 30 Piece Bit-Check Universal/30 Bit-check with Rapidaptor is designed for compact and organized tool storage. Torsion (TZ) bits are designed to prevent premature wear for improved service life. Rapidaptor Universal bit holder with quick-release chuck for rapid one-handed bit changes for insert and power bits. Wera bit-checks feature a compact design to safely store bits and bit holders in a package that is thinner than the biggest tool contained. So slim it can fit into your pocket. Slide switch allows for one-handed opening of bit-check for easy tool removal. Sorted by drive and size, tools are easy to locate and return to proper position, making missing products easy to identify. Bit-Check Universal/30 Bit-check set includes Rapidaptor Universal bit holder with quick-release chuck and 29 bits, 1 TZ Slotted bit - 7/32\"; 5 Hex-Plus bits - 3mm, 4mm, 5mm, 6mm, 8mm; 6 TZ Phillips bits - 2 x PH1, 3 x PH2, PH3; 6 TZ Pozidriv bits - 2 x PZ1, 3 x PZ2, PZ3; 6 TZ TORX bits - TX10, TX15, TX20, TX25, TX30, TX40; 5 TORX BO bits - TX10 BO, TX15 BO, TX20 BO, TX25 BO, TX30 BO, with a maximum torque applied of up to 50 N-m, these bits held up well.I've used these bits in a Bosch, Milwaukee, Craftsman and DeWalt 12-Volt power tools without a problem. These Wera bits are some of the finest that you'll find. Wera is a high-end tool maker. Wera is one of the world's leading manufacturers of screw driving tools under the Wera, Kraftform, and Zyklop brands. The company was founded in 1941 and is headquartered in Wuppertal, Germany. Wera develops and produces tools for professional and industrial applications, and is a solution provider for problems associated with screw connections. Quality is assured through a manufacturing process that is continually monitored. Wera is International Standard Organization (ISO) certified. Wera has received several awards for the stylish and ergonomic design of its products. These bits were Made in the Czech Republic under the German manufacturing standards.N-m = One newton metre is equal to the torque resulting from a force of one newton applied perpendicularly to a moment arm which is one metre long.1 newton metre = 0.7375621 pound-foot (often (incorrectly) \"foot-pound\")Pozidriv = reg. trademark of European Industrial Service Ltd., is an improved version of the Phillips screw drive.Drill bits:Dewalt DW1361 Titanium Pilot Point Drill Bit Set, 21 Pieces:I've been using these bits for a couple of years now and they work very well and the bits stay sharp. For around the house jobs that involve wood these drill bits work extremely well. Dewalt's titanium drill bits have a titanium coating that provides longer life when drilling in non-ferrous metals. These bits are also suitable for drilling in wood and plastic and are ideal for commercial and residential applications. The tough plastic case makes a wonderful holding place so the bits do not get lost and it fits inside my tool box for greater protection, the sizes range from 1/6-inch to 1/2-inch in the case.When building a deck on my house I used these bits to make holes for bolts in the timbers and the holes to run electrical conduit for the lights and receptacles. By drilling holes, I was able to hide the conduit within the structure of the deck, making a good finished look. The bits saved time by staying sharp and I didn't need to replace any of the bits used. In the case of pilot holes, where receptacles were anchored to a solid structural support it made driving screws much easier with a finished look that you couldn't achieve by using nails.Caveat:Be sure to read, understand and follow all warnings, safety rules and instructions in the operator's manual before using this tool.  Failure to do so can result in serious personal injury. Always use ANSI Z87.1 eye protection , eye shields or full face shield and dust mask when operating power tools. If you run into a problem with loosened bits, a solution would be replacing the chuck with a Jacobs 3/8 chuck. Jacobs Chuck 30354 3/8-Inch Key-less Chuck for 3/8-Inch 24 Thread Spindle. This chuck has a ratcheting feature which locks bits in place. Also, there are bit holders made by Wera that work very well with this type of drill/driver for bit driving different types of screws.",

        "reviewText": "I got this drill/driver as a freebie from Sears when I bought a right angle impact driver\u00a0Craftsman 9-17562 Nextec 12-volt Right-Angle Impact Driver.  I already own a compact C3 Drill/Driver\u00a0Craftsman C3 19.2 Volt Cordless Lithium Ion 1/2\" Compact Drill Driver (11910) (Tool Only, No Battery or Charger)\u00a0so didn't know if I needed this drill/driver or not.Today I added some new boards to an existing shelf.  First I tried using my C3 Drill/Driver.  However, I found that even with the C3 Compact drill/driver, the weight of the drill/driver was difficult to balance.  So, I decided to try the Nextec Drill/Driver.  There was a noticeable difference in weight.  Not only that, but there was enough power using the drill/driver to put up the boards in the shelf.This drill/driver is great for jobs (such as shelving and cabinets) that don't require heavy duty work, yet has enough power to get the job done.  The light weight of the drill is ideal for this type of use.What I like:- lightweight body and battery- battery lasts a long time- built-in LED lightWhat I dislike:- grip is a bit wider than some other drills (I think because the grip goes around the battery)- doesn't have some extra features like a built-in level or area to hold bits- sometimes under heavy load, the chuck gets loose and bits slip offOverall, for a job that doesn't take heavy driving/drilling this drill is great. It's not underpowered, yet feels very light. For my hands, the grip seems a bit wider than other drills I own, yet when using, the grip is not slippery or anything.To solve the issue of bits coming loose, I ended up replacing the chuck with a Jacobs 3/8 chuck.\u00a0Jacobs Chuck 30354 3/8-Inch Keyless Chuck for 3/8-Inch 24 Thread Spindle. This chuck has a racheting feature which locks bits in place. Now the bits stay put while I'm working!Since the drill was a freebie, and I solved the loose bit problem, this drill definnitely is a keeper.",

This thing is light, and small but out performs any big heavy drill you could get. Buy this and the other tools that use the same battery and you'll never run out of batteries. Also charges pretty quick. Not an over night ordeal like other tools. Can't say enough good things about it. Just remember to get a battery and charger with it!",

        "reviewText": "This drill is unbelievably GREAT! it works as good as my 18V DeWalt and lasts as long, weighs less, Just as strong and a TON Cheaper! I was blown away with it's performance! I used it for a large project that required a ton of 3 inch screws and I did not pre-drill any of the holes! It is still going strong!AS STATED, Batteries NOT INCLUDED! charger is also sold separately, the reason is the batteries used in this are also used in several other tools sold under the Nextec name. Why you ask? To save you money. Buy one set with the batteries, you can get this same drill with the batteries and charger, but it will cost slightly more, however then you buy other Nextec tools such as a right angle drill or a sander or whatever, but a low price because you buy the one WITHOUT batteries and charger because you do not need them anymore! You have them already. If you need to use 2 or 3 of the Nextec tools at once you can buy a battery for each one. The batteries are easily swapped and they charge extremely fast and last longer than the old heavy Ni-cad batteries! and the best part is, if you need one fast and can't wait to get one from Amazon, you can run down to the local sears and grab one at a decent price. Amazon is always cheaper but sometimes you have to pay for convenience! Look around, 1 bad review and sadly it was because they didn't notice it did not include the battery? So I am writing this to tell you that this is one of my favorite inventions in tools in a long time! Do Not base your purchase on the review that has one star! the description is clear and this review is clear! If you need one with batteries just look for model Craftsman 17586 it includes battery. If you want to get an idea and possibly try one before you buy it, go to sears! My local sears has one you can try. while your there check out the prices! You can't beat Amazons Price even with Shipping! This item being reviewed is on sale right now at sears for $55.00 Plus Tax! Don't take my word for it go try one or just go to sears website or look for independent reviews online, you will quickly see that I am not the only one that loves this series of products! As a matter of fact I am begging you to comparison shop on sears website, Amazons prices will amaze you! Sears is at least double!I will also add, I do NOT work for Sears or Amazon! I just love this product! And I love to see people get a good product at a good price! I always give honest reviews and always write them fairly! feel free to read my other reviews and take a minute to write your own reviews, just be fair and remember, these reviews here are to rate the product, not the seller or what you misunderstood. No offense to any other reviewers!",

It's hard to find battery capacities, but digging through the DeWalt website I found this drill uses DCB203 batteries which hold 2 amp-hours of energy.  My DCD760's DC9181 batteries are good, but hold only 1.1 amp-hours.  This drill's battery pack is more compact, too (my older one's battery pack has a lot of air space in it).  I find the feel, the balance of these drills to be notably better than others I've had or handled, testing them out at Home Depot & Sears.  That's important if you use it a lot, or need to use it in tight spaces or awkward situations. It's the best drill I've owned.",

The chuck somehow loosens and the drill/driver falls to the ground and I spend more time looking for the lost item then actually using the tool.  How Bosch product control allowed this to happen is bizarre.  I read the reviews before purchasing and numerous people indicated same problem,,,,so I should of known better.  It now sits on the top shelf in my workshop where it belongs.....did not have the heart to throw in the dumpster.  STAY AWAY from this drill.",

I was assembling a hanging plant basket holder and finally out of frustration tried to go into the trunk of a 10 year old Palm tree-NO GO.

Hopefully I will get around to that some day.I have used this dozens of times as a driver and a drill.

I can't really say that I have had any issues at all with this drill and it works perfect for all the DYI projects I have had at home.  I am not sure it would hold up as well as a higher priced option if you are using this on a daily basis for large construction projects but it is perfect for the home.It has a clip on either side of the base to store drill bits.

        "reviewText": "TL;DR: Buy something else unless power to weight is all you care about.I'm not sure what to say about this drill that hasn't already been said. Everything you've read is true, all the good and all the bad. This is the most powerful, lowest weight drill you can buy. It is also the lowest quality drill I have ever owned from any manufacturer. I am on my third drill in 90 days. The first was just a piece of junk and couldn't drill a round hole. The second lasted 80 days of light weekend use before the chuck failed and wouldn't tighten reliably.First the pros:+ Lowest weight 18v drill you can buy.+ While there are several more powerful drills you can buy, they weigh much more.+ Replacement batteries are reasonably priced.+ While you can buy more powerful batteries, the 2.0 ah batteries balance well with the drill, charge fast, and last an impossibly long time.+ The drill has enough power to handle most jobs. If you need more power, you are moving up to a higher weight class of drill.+ Cold temperatures (5-10f) have little effect on battery life.+ Higher maximum RPM than other drills.The cons:- Quality control is non-existent- The chuck wobbles. I have seen more than 10 of these and they all have chuck wobble. To be precise, I don't think the wobble comes from the chuck, I think the bearings/bushings are of extremely poor quality.- Drill bits fall out. This is a design flaw, it has nothing to do with how much you tighten the chuck, and it doesn't matter which way the drill is pointing. It wears over time and you will lose drill bits. If you are working with large, expensive bits, or working above other people, this will become a problem.- Fit and finish is unimpressive. The battery clunks around.- High vibration in the second speed.- The chuck is prone to rusting if used in wet environments.Bottom line: My other drill is a 10-year-old Milwaukee cordless hammer drill that is beat to hell and runs just like when it was new. While the Milwaukee is an amazing tool and balances perfectly, it also weighs 7 lb and you can no longer buy quality batteries for it. The Dewalt weighs 3.5 lb. with the 2.0 ah battery and is every bit as powerful. If you need a powerful drill, buy a brushless Makita. If you need the highest quality drill at close to the weight of the Dewalt and close to the power of the Makita, buy the Milwaukee Fuel 18v. If you need the lightest possible drill that still has enough power for most any job, buy the Dewalt DCD790. This is why I am now on my third drill, because on paper this is the drill I need. However, if this one fails too, I will move to Milwaukee Fuel 18v. If Makita comes out with a high quality, lightweight battery I will go with that.UPDATE: After just a couple months of use, the third drill has a huge amount of chuck wobble and while the chuck locks, it loosens during use. I am starting to accept that the quality I need is not available in a drill of this weight. It is a shame because for the majority of what most people do with drills, this one is perfect.",

She handled it effortlessly and could not get enough of driving wood screws.  I was hoping she'd enjoy doing that with me, but be careful what you wish for -- now she wants to use \"my\" drill all the time.  Not a problem -- I got the spare battery, so she gets tired before the drill does.  Now if I could just get the dog to go into the doghouse...",

        "reviewText": "After owning this for 3 years, I did several smaller home projects like putting up shelves and drilling in pictures. My last project with this was building 2x 6' benches. I had to recharge several times. It struggled driving 2 1/2\" screws in 2x4s. I'm sure this thing was probably on its last legs anyways, but this was the last straw. I set 3/5 stars because it worked like it was supposed too for 3 years, but you can now get a Dewalt 20V Max for a little bit more.I just bought a 20V Max Dewalt drill/driver combo and the difference is night and day. The Dewalt drives like a champ and the drill is amazing. I had to drill through a double top-plate (2x 2x4s) to run new electrical. It was doing it so fast that the first hole I drilled, I was confused by how fast it went. I thought I had drilled in the drywall (I was doing this in the attic with insulation and poor lighting). At one point, I even drilled through 3x 2x4s (2 kings, 1 jack stud) and the speed of the drill was only limited by my drill bit and lack of knowledge of how to do it properly (I later learned I was supposed to be pulling it in and out to get the debris out of the way); but even then, it had no problems. I've since done so many other things with the Dewalt that I'm confident in its quality and power.However, the Dewalt combo cost $200... on sale. Just the drill is about $110. The Hitachi was fine when I was moving around from apartment to apartment, but there is no way I could do anything I need to do now that I own a house. Well, I guess it could, but jobs probably would take 2-3x longer. The bottome-line: Priced under $100, this is fine. But if you're going to do some serious work, spend the extra money and get a Dewalt 20V Max. If you're in a money pinch, just set your expectations accordingly.",

My last drill from the local hardware store was around $80 with maybe 10 accessories, a soft case/bag, and less power.I dislike:-While the battery last considerably longer than my old drill's did, I did have to stop and let it charge for a few hours during my project. One battery is simply not enough to include. I will be searching for a second one in the near future. I'm subtracting a star for this reason.I would recommend this drill. Great price for quality and everything included. For normal home use, I don't think this will let you down.",

It actually works well as long as what your adjusting requires almost no Torque, like opening a case for a computer.It will not consistently drive screws into a wall. Drywall & Wood are a no go. And in reverse, if it encounters resistance, it unscrews itself and the bit falls out. Extremely frustrating on the top of a ladder.The quality of the bit is also suspect. I have had 4 of the bits break.The best part of this product is the battery. It was the same battery I use for my Black & Decker Weed Whip and Blower. They only came with a single battery and now I have 2.Buyer Beware!",

I like craftsman products, as they tend to be better in quality from other brands.I gave them 4 stars because all I needed was the battery pack, but I dont know why but the battery cost about the same as a set of drill with the battery!!  So, in my opinion a little over priced as I just needed the battery.",

I read through a LOT of info on various drills (including reviews) and through many batteries for those drills.  This was the lightest drill that had the best torque.  Another reviewer stated that he used ti commercially and remarked how well it did and how light it was.  It got me thinking that holding a heavy drill through a tough job would probably fatigue the hand/wrist fast and through his time in the military and all his time working outdoors, the last thing my husband would want is more hand/wrist pains.  So, I went with this drill.  I also liked how easily the battery was said to go into it and is as easily removed.It's light weight, the torque is perfect the battery lasts a long time and charges up fast :)I bought it with the DEWALT DCB201 1.5-Ah 20-Volt Lithium-Ion Compact Battery.  This is being used commercially (he works on planes) and so far he's thrilled... and everyone is asking to borrow it lol.",

        "reviewText": "Wow! I could not have thought that this tool was so large and relatively heavy. However, that said, it is an excellently designed tool. I used it in very tight corners in which the tool had to be steadied in order to achieve optimum operation. Nonetheless, the fact is that the tool has the torque to power through the toughest wood. I tried it on one of our hardest woods-mora- and the screws went through quite easily.  It is a fantastic tool  but cannot be expected to fit and operate the same way in all situations.The main downside to this tool is its unrelenting power which can ruin a project with screws that have gone beyond tight. You have to exercise caution as initially, the trigger control may not work as intended. Honestly, I would have preferred a clutch with individual torque settings. In summary, though, the tool is a great companion that should adorn every toolbox. However, beware because its main asset-power-may become its downfall if the trigger is not properly controlled. The downside is insufficient to me, to warrant the removal of a star, because a lot has to do with the user of the tool and where and on what, it  will be used. Purchase one and see for yourself, it is a good investment.Best wishesHenry.",

I would give it a 4.5... It essentially overheated (after going through more than 6\" continuous piece of wood) and gave little warning, just stopped working for about 2 hours.

This one's actually smaller, well-balanced in the hand, and very powerful.  It adds the hammer drill capability (which I don't anticipating having a use for, but you never know) to the reversible drill and screwdriver settings.  Agree the lamp is kinda silly, as the chuck blanks it from the drilling surface unless you've got a LONG drill bit.  But that's a nit.  The other nit: the included screwdriver bit requires a NOT included clip to hold it to the drill, an odd omission (that clip is shown as an orderable accessory -- the one that comes with the drill is for hanging the drill on a toolboard).",

        "reviewText": "I was looking to upgrade from an older 12 volt BD cordless. After 12 years the charger gave up. I thought about replacing the charger but decided to use it as an excuse to upgrade.I thought I would really like this drill, but I have been disappointed.-It doesn't come with a case. Fortunately, it fit right into my old drill's case.-My old drill had a 24 position clutch. This drill only has 11 and 10 of them are worthless. I thought it wouldn't make that much of a difference, but I've used it for about a dozen projects and all of them have required the clutch to be set in the drill position which has caused some problems with sinking screws in too far. My old drill never had this problem.-After using this drill on and off for 30 minutes, the  web of my thumb or the base of my thumb that leads up to my pointer finger began to hurt. I noticed that the top of the handle has some ribbed rubber and is fashioned in a way that makes your hand hold the drill further down the handle. This was causing some discomfort while using the drill and I also began to notice that I had to use my other hand to provide pressure at the back of the drill more often than usual.-I lost the bit. The bit holder is just magnetic and they moved it to the top from the base to make room for the light. When you put your other hand at the back of the drill, your hand will move or knock the bit off.-Some thing is \"off\" with the key-less chuck. Despite tightening the chuck as hard as I can, the bits keep falling out. I eventually had to coat my sliding sleeve bit holder with rubber cement so the drill wouldn't let it slide out.I had very high hopes for this drill. Part of me wishes that I had just bought another charger.",

I bought the jigsaw attachment and am very pleased with the performance! This is extremely powerful and does everything I've thrown at it so far.My one complaint is that the battery dies a little quick which is an okay trade off for me for having a compact, versatile drill.The battery dies after I've been using the jigsaw to cut about 7 feet or so. It's lithium so it has full power right up until it dies, which prevents bad malfunctions when doing touchy tasks. I would recommend a second battery if you're doing much more than drilling/screwing, I found one here on Amazon for about $23. If you're a professional who would be using this all day, I'm not sure if this is ideal but I would assume you may need more than 2 batteries.It is extremely skinny and therefore makes it great for tight spaces. For some of the things I'm using this for, I literally would not be able to do them if the drill were any wider. The fact that you can attach so many items is great for a hobbyist like myself who doesn't want to devote a lot of space / money to a tool collection.",

        "reviewText": "When my old Hitachi 12V NiCad-powered drill motor burned up a few months ago, I was kind of glad. It meant that I had an excuse to upgrade! I'm not a pro, so my tools don't get beat up day after day. My goal was to get a higher-end consumer-level product, since my needs don't justify spending top dollar on Makita etc. My shopping criteria:1) 1/2 inch chuck that grabs real tight and won't let go. My old drill had a 3/8 inch chuck that would never tighten down enough. It's really annoying when bits slip while drilling. :(2) Li-ion batteries. I previously avoided anything over 12V because the Ni-Cd batteries are annoyingly large and heavy. But the right 18V Li-ion battery can be smaller and lighter than my old 12V Ni-Cd. Ni-Cd batteries also lose capacity/lifespan if you top off their charge too often, instead preferring a near-complete discharge before recharging. Li-ion batteries don't have this restriction.3) Robust system of compatible tools.Now, on to the review! I'll start with the accessories.Bag/case: To me, the zipper bag is more flexible for real-world use than the typical molded plastic hard case. I pack this drill, my PC18ID impact driver, an extra battery, and a bunch of bits/extensions/sockets into this bag.Batteries: I really like this kit because you get 2 compact Li-ion batteries (PCL18BLX) which retail for $70 each instead of just one. I've only fully discharged one of these batteries one time, lighting up my attic with the PC18AL area lamp. They last plenty long for my needs. This past weekend, I put them to a good test, drilling 700+ holes and driving 700+ 2\" deck screws. 1 battery on the drill, one on the driver. Whenever I needed to take a break (do some cutting, lunch, HD run), I would put one of the batteries on the charger to top it off. Next break, charge the other one instead. I never ran out of juice... When I first got this kit, the charger indicated that one of the batteries had a fault of some sort. I took it to the local P-C service center, and they swapped it for a brand new one.Charger: Very user-friendly. You can leave one battery on the charger indefinitely without risking overcharge damage, while the other battery is on your tool. 30 minute recharge time for the included batteries is very nice. Fault & over-temp detection.Drill: Best drill I've ever owned. Plenty of power, even in the high-speed setting. The chuck is exactly what I was looking for. It tightens down very strongly, doesn't loosen up over repeated stop/start of the tool, yet is easy to loosen when it's time for a bit change. Speed control is good, light is slightly useful. Tool isn't overly heavy and stands up nicely with good balance with the included battery installed. I haven't used it much as a driver, but as a drill, it's been unstoppable and very easy to handle.Some of the other P-C kits come with a drill and/or batteries that aren't as nice as this one. (Compare the drill chucks, torque, and battery capacity in particular.) In my opinion, it's better to get this kit, and then add on whatever bare tools you need.So overall, I'm very happy with this kit. It meets all of the criteria I laid out at the start. As I hinted earlier, I've also added the excellent PC18ID impact driver and the PC18AL area light to my P-C 18V tool collection. I've got my eye on the PC18CSL circular saw, the PC18HV hand vac, and the PCC583B inflator too. :)",

Well built with plenty of power. I bought it as a back up to my Makita drill and driver combo. It's a little heavier than the Makita but seems to be just as powerful and as well built at a much lower price point than my Makita was, in fact almost half the price. I like the very stout metal drill chuck that also can be tightened and released with one hand. Each tool has a built in led light which helps when working in harder to see places like inside a cabinet etc. Comes with two batteries and charging unit in a soft zippered cloth case. Have used these for about six months now and they are holding up and performing well. At Amazon.com's current price, it's the best value currently on the market. I suspect they'll be selling a lot of these. See all my tool reviews (345 plus)on Wood Magazines \" Review a Tool \" website.",

I had just returned a Bosch DDS181-02 which had more than acceptable chuck wobble.  This drill has a slight wobble in the chuck as well, but significantly less than the Bosch had (and another Bosch I tested at Lowe's).  I'm not sure at what price point you have to get to for a compact cordless drill without chuck wobble??The transmission high/low gear switch is smooth and has positive feel.The clutch has consistent slip/torque and is easy to dial in.  1 thru 23 and lock-up. (Description advises 22 positions...but there is a 23rd between 22 and locked.The chuck has never loosened up during operation, and has a metal cover versus plastic like on the Bosch.Forward, reverse, lock-up switch is easy to use with trigger finger and thumb.Trigger is smooth and allows you to dial in the speed you want.Light can be used without engaging drill motor.  However the light does get blocked by the chuck if you are not using a long bit.  But it is handy for dark places to at least shed some light on the subject.My only real issue is that the chuck does have some slight movement/wobble.I only have an hour or two on the drill...using around the house for odd jobs and an old travel trailer gut and refurb.Batteries...no issues with them at this time.  Drain as expected and charge as expected.Recommend for the DIYer...suspect you'll get your money out of it.  I also purchased a Porter-Cable Bare-Tool PC18ID to go with it...a great addition and time saver.",

        "reviewText": "Pros: Nice handling, Metal outer chuck, Spring battery eject, Really nice storage caseCons: No battery level meter, LED shadows due to long chuckI pulled out the PCL180CDK as soon as we realized that it would be the perfect fit for a couple projects I had replacing and installing some storm doors on a house in my neighborhood. As I tend to review tools in real-world scenarios whenever possible, the job at hand allowed me to use the tool on both drilling and driving tasks in a variety of repetitive and overhead tasks. In removing the screws to an older screen door that was being replaced we found the Porter-Cable to perform very consistently and have a decent amount of speed to quickly remove the screws that were embedded in the hard wood frame. When we secured the new aluminum frame to the existing wood, the drill made quick work of driving the zinc-plated fasteners home.In doing this job I had to lift the drill overhead quite a bit and were surprised that it was a bit heavier than other \"Compact\" models currently on the market (the PCL180CDK weighs around 3.8 lbs with the included LX battery pack). That's not to say that this drill is heavy or unwieldy, but it felt like it was similar in size as some of the second generation hammer drills, which have grown considerably more compact in recent years. What offsets this is the position of the handle, which is very centered and delivers a really well-balanced feel. In fact, if you have larger hands, the grip, while a perfect fit for me, might actually be a bit tight.  The grip was secure and quite comfortable, with our middle, ring and pinky fingers taking up all the available room on the handle just below the trigger.  I loved the battery eject mechanism on this tool. When you push the button, the tool literally throws the battery at you - which is incredibly helpful when you want to swap them out quickly and easily. Finally, the included 30 minute charger supports both Lithium-ion and NiCD chemistry sled batteries so you can use it for all your modern Porter-Cable tools.You can buy more robust tools, drills that are more compact and put out greater torque, but you'll also pay considerably more. The lack of a battery level indicator is about the biggest ding we can give the PCL180CDK, and we hope they will adjust this in their next generation of products. This drill/driver performs well which makes it easy to recommend, even in a sea of tough competition.",

It comes with one rather cheap sawzall blade, I bought a 9\" pruning blade and it had sufficient power to trim some large bushes I have. Also used a metal blade to cut off some wall screws that were stripped and couldn't be removed. I think it has good power for a saw compared to a corded recipricol saw. Battery has lasted on the saw and the drill for about 2.5 hours and it was still going strong. The drill is light and slightly smaller than the bigger industrial grade drills (Dewalt) I have. The smaller size has come in handy for smaller work areas. Not a heavy duty drill for business use, but good for the once a month projects I have come up around two houses. Drill has plenty of power at 20V. It has a 3/8 chuck that is metal, and it has a light that comes on when drilling, that is a nice feature for the small areas I have worked in. Have had for about 1 month now. Will post back if any of the set prematurely stops working. For a sale price, it was a good buy for me, if you expect heavy, extended use, look at Dewalt or other industrial tools.",

I can do a lot of pruning with a single battery, and this sucker comes in pretty handy.The drill is great, though previous versions had a better hot swap design for switching from drilling to driving.  But for what amounts to a sub $50 drill, I am absolutely not complaining.The battery life on the drill is fantastic.  I was drilling in 200 feet of decking with self-tapping hex screws, no pre-drill, and this thing ran all day on a single charge.Like others have said, these batteries smart charge, so there's no concern about leaving them on the charger and killing the cells.",

I did not see a need to get a new set since the batteries were the same voltage and mine seemed to still work fine.  This drill only item was just want I needed.  I was a bit leery about it working with my batteries since the model itself mentioned only a few supported ones, but the listing stated it worked will all batteries so I decided to go for it.  I am very happy that I was able to save money and also be more environmentally conscious re-using the batteries and charger.My original drill lasted for several years and I expect this one will last just as long.

I get the drill and everything is made in China: Tool - made in China, Charger - made in China, Carrying case - made in China, Batteries - cells made in Korea or Malaysia with additional processing in China.

The only issue I've had with it is that it does not come with many bits and no bits are offered on Panasonic's or Amazon's website when looking for compatible bits.  I did find that the Milwaukee 48-32-1500 Quik-Lok 38-Piece Hex Shank Drilling and Driving Bit Set works perfectly with this tool.  (I tried several of my older bits from a variety of electric drivers and drills.  One took a great deal of effort to remove due to the incorrect location and dimension of the indentation that holds the bit in the tool.)One thing to note is that the front piece on the tool sets the torque for the device.  If you do not turn the torque up to a higher number it will appear as if the device does not work.  I leave mine on the highest setting.",

The batteries charge in about 10 minutes (or less). The clutch is accurate and it is strong enough to drive a 1 1/4 screw flush into a 2X4. My only complaint it that since the Lithium Ion battery is so light and the gear mechanism so heavy duty the balance is not great. I have found that I can install switches and receptacles non-stop on one battery for about 3-4 hours. A low torque application but I'm happy with the battery life.",

        "reviewText": "I debated getting this screwdriver for a very long time due to its cost after seeing its predecessor in a store and liking the feel of it as it is one of those tools that makes you say \"Ooh, well made tool!\" when first picked up. Now after having it for a couple years, I wouldn't be without it as I didn't realize how much time I was wasting with a manual screwdriver. I use it primarily for computer repair (torque control clutch is great) and IT infrastructure work - rack and wall plate screws, cable management duct mounting, workstation table assembly, etc. It excels at its intended application with machine screws and shorter self-tapping or pre-drilled wood screws, but it is not a construction driver with high torque. The batteries are fast charging and the case is one of the best designed tool cases I've encountered with storage for extra batteries and driving accessories such as long bits, extensions, chuck, and screws. The only nitpick I have is that the LED light is yellowish and embarrassingly dim compared to my Fenix E01 LED keychain light given the cost of the screwdriver. Still, this is a great tool.",

Everything about this is exceptional. Surely beats those Black&Decker $25 models in almost every aspect. Highly recommended. The only minor inconvenience is the fact that the case that is provided is molded, so you cannot use it to carry additional tools. Trust Panasonic, it is used #1 in Japan. The screwdriver bits lock into place so they don't always fall out, battery is light and recharges quickly. Flashlight is integrated and helps when working at night. Comes with 2 batteries out of the box, two-speed model high and low. Highly satisfied customer.",

There was no return documentation in the box from AudioVideoDirect. I e-mailed Hitachi and got no response. The only recourse I could find on Amazon was to send the entire package back for a refund (repack and drive to the UPS store). I opted to buy a spare battery for $40 rather than be without a drill for three weeks. The flashlight has an incandescent filament (old-style) bulb. It puts out a wide pool of yellow light. I can't imagine it will last long on a single charge, and it takes up half of the storage case. If I can buy an LED flashlight for $10, couldn't they use an LED bulb in a $100 drill kit? I bought this drill after reading a consumer website report. So far the drill works fine, but the buying experience makes me wish I had gone to the local hardware store.",

I have owned the drill for about 2-3 years in which time I used it heavily around the house to make a lot of home improvements including to drive several hundred large lag bolts into my deck and home, building a large shed, and working in the garage.  This has gotten a lot of heavy use which may explain why it has had a few problems recently: one of my batteries died last week and sometimes (once in a long while) the drill will get \"out of gear\" and make a loud grinding noise until I stop and try again.  I have never used the separate flashlight because I need the batteries for my drill and I have separate headlamps. I wish instead that it had a small LED light built into the front like some do.  This model does not have this feature.  Overall a good drill that has served me well but is starting to wear out. I will need to find a replacement soon.",

No need to buy two tools, more batteries, etc.  The impact driver is a life saver when driving 3 or 4 inch screws and lag bolts.  I bought the bigger battery (Black & Decker LB2X4020-OPE 4.0 Ah Lithium Battery Pack, 20-volt) because I sometimes need to use the drill/driver for several hours and didn't want to recharge  the battery that came with it.",

The black and orange look really makes things look very sharp and classy when compared to the previous look which was mostly just orange.Anyway, the drill has worked great for me. It's got plenty of power, and the clutch system works perfectly. The handle has a great rubber feel that is very comfortable, even when pushing down hard on a screw. The balance is really good when setting it down. I had another drill that, when you put it down, you really had to set it down slowly and carefully or else it would fall forward. This one has the drill part pushed back more so that the center of gravity is right over the middle of the battery, so it stays up better.I can't say much about the impact wrench attachment since I haven't had a chance to use it all that much. From the times I have used it, it has worked like it should. Since it doesn't have  clutch on it, I've stripped out a couple bolts with it, but that's my own fault, not the tool's.I really like the idea of the Matrix system, and am looking forward to getting some more of their attachments for other purposes.",

I used it with the impact driver to drill in about 60 5\" lag screws with 3/8\" diameter without any pre drilling.  I was impressed with how much power it delivered on the big lag screws.  As a test I tried driving the lag screws with my electric drill and could only get them in half way.  I also did a test with a large handheld socket wrench and it was difficult to drive them all the way in by hand.  I did all 60 lag screws in one charge and then a bunch of additional work after that.  Great tool to add to the collection.",

I have just about all of the attachments, and I use most of them on average 2-3 times a month., so not heavy use, and certainly not contractor level work.It's nice to have a compact set around that pretty much fits into a small (18\" x 12\" x 10\") bag. It usually has enough power to do what I want it to do and the battery has plenty of charge even on tough jobs (unlike the old diehard 19.5V system...). Whether I'm wood working, working on my car, repairing a wall/drain/old chair, there is a use for it. I also just purchased the (B&D) corded power unit, which is pretty nice, when there's power within range...The reason this loses two stars from me is because of Craftsman and their current mentality. I have been looking for the past couple of weeks for a way to replace/repair my unit because the motor burned out. This happens with battery powered electronics, and it served it's time (~2 years), so I'm not holding that against it. However, the only option seems to be to buy a whole new set. I don't need the drill attachment, or the battery, or the charger... I have several spare batteries from other items in the same family and they charge fast enough that a second charger is just silly.So, rather than buying what I need from the manufacturer, I'm forced to go to ebay where I can get just the handle and the drill (still getting another unwanted drill :P ) for about $30.Just to be thorough, here is a list of options I've found, these all include shipping:*Replace whole drill $79.99 in store, $85.99 here*Buy B&D Matrix (same tool) here or in Walmart for $58.10*Buy just the Craftsman power unit and drill attachment from ebay for $32.43*Buy B&D Matrix just power unit and drill from ebay for $29.99For this reason, I'll likely just buy the B&D, which comes with a 2 year warranty (unlike the 1 yr on Craftsman) and be done with them... This is really disappointing because I've been buying Craftsman for more than a decade...",

I love the idea of having a single bag filled with a range of tools to handle any job; but the motor simply doesn't deliver.  At first I thought maybe I simply purchased a defective unit, I requested a replacement as the driver was still new and i was sent a new unit.  Long story short, I tried to finish the job, sure enough the unit started to smoke after the second lag.",

All motors spark, just with this drill the air vents are made bigger for better ventalation and so you can see it spark, other drills have very small tiny vents and that why you dont see the sparks. other thing is the little burning smell you get when you first use it, hello its brand new barely used it needs broke in, the smell goes away after alittle bit. last people think its suppose to be the top of the line proffesional drill, its not and was never meant to be, it was designed for the avergage person to use and projects they do. i say craftsman did it again, making a great heavy duty tool and should be proud to stand behind it, battery is fast charging and lasts along time. do me a favor and dont listen to these guys who compalin about it, its a craftsman and the company stands behind it, their all about satifaction and making the customer happy.",

        "reviewText": "QUICK PSA for those who few people who may know even less about power tools than I do:Getting the chuck to close for the first time is tough and you will SWEAR it is broken because it grinds and clicks like you are winding a giant watch.  However, after that, opening and closing the chuck is smooth and easy.-----------------I never thought I would be the kind of chick that would be into power tools.  I know my ex never met a power tool he didn't like and after we separated, he gave me one of the nicest gifts ever -- a Milwaukee 18v power drill.  It gave me the ability and feeling of accomplishment of learning how to do stuff for myself.When I left the Milwaukee 1000 miles away in my cabin that is being renovated, I knew I needed to get another drill for home.  However, the Milwaukee was twice the price of this one.  I originally bought a 12V Skill for 40 bucks from Amazon's sister site -- woot but it wasn't up to the first job I tried:  to disassemble and reassemble my cubicle at work to turn it into a standing height desk.I had read great reviews about the Bosch and it was significantly cheaper so I decided to to give this a shot.  So this is my 3rd drill that I have owned so I was fairly familiar with power tools and how to work a keyless chuck.  So when I first got it, of course, the first thing I tried to do was open the chuck.  I read the instructions and it just (appeared) to not budge.  It just clicked and clicked and I thought I was going be stripping it.  Eventually, I noticed the prongs that grip the drill bit were actually closing.  Once I finally got it all the way closed, the chuck would turn and open and close with a smooth quiet operation.Since then, the drill has been great.  It is not as balanced as my Milwaukee but it is every bit as tough.  It tackled my cube renovation process with ease... the guys in my group were all coveting my drill -- most of them owning Makitas and Milwaukees.The batteries hold a charge and last quite awhile both under heavy use or left sitting on the workbench for extended periods.I still really like my Milwaukee but I also really like the extra hundred bucks that I can spend on... well, other tools.  I finally get why my ex was gone for so long whenever he made a home depot run![NCJVR]",

About that same time, we made one smart purchase, this Panasonic drill.Since then, we've helped construct our own home, done all the interior finish work on a 5,000 sf shop and a 3500 sf garage, built a huge deck and other assorted \"weekend warrior\" projects, all of which have included this drill.It's been dragged in the frozen dirt underneath the house while we were building the deck supports, it's been dropped more times that I can count, it's put up with rain, freezing cold, and baking heat, and never had a single problem. We're even using the original battery packs!I can't say enough about how much we love this thing. Even better is how well it handles, how comfortable it is to use for extended periods, and how easy it is to switch directions, even for my small hands.Unfortunately, a few weeks ago during a fencing project, the drill started to smell a bit like ozone, so I knew the motor was getting ready to die. So, that's why I'm back here, not to complain about the fact that it's finally giving up the ghost, but to purchase another one. It's rare to see an battery-operated product that is still available even after a few years, but to see this same product on the market nearly a decade later, and still a top seller, that says something for the high quality build of this drill.Honestly, even if it's twice as much as you were thinking about spending, just buy one. You won't be disappointed.",

This drill isn't backed by expensive marketing or gimmicky terminology.  I recently looked at a drill from a brand that was made primarily from white plastic.  Makes me think it's good for putting up pictures on the wall, screwing together IKEA furniture, but not much else...The EY6432 drill is efficiently designed with quality materials throughout.  This drill has Ni-MH batteries which aren't the newest technology, but they're dependable and rebuildable if you're especially adventurous.  The battery packs are well-vented and fit securely.  Li-ION batteries aren't better, they just have a higher energy density, thus they're lighter.The speed control and trigger are amazingly accurate and smooth operating.  You pay for the internals of this drill not glued on rubber, graphics and hype.Yes, it's made in China.  In this case, that hasn't affected its build quality.  A few years ago people scoffed at Made in Japan.  Now we associate that country with quality products.

It has helped me on every home repair project on my circa 1836 house.  Never a spec of trouble.  Feels great in the hand, especially for people with smaller hands.  It has never had a lack of torque.  I havent pulled the corded drills out of the drawer for years because there is simply no need if you have this drill.  The original batteries died about 2 years ago (which means at least 8 years life, probably 10).  I rewired one of the batteries with internet cells and it works great. I am planning on adding a large home addition next year and plan to buy another Panasonic so I have 2 drill bodies and 2 more batteries.  I seriously have zero complaints about this drill!",

I logged huge hours on it over 25 years drilling wood, metal and masonry before it finally gave out.  I bought this slightly more powerful one as the replacement and I've been just as happy.  I really don't think they have much in the way of competition, except I do dearly wish the batteries lasted longer and were Lithium Ion.  They are expensive to replace and if you don't have a backup in the charging cradle at all times you will be letting some colorful language fly when it dies on you.  Still, most cordless products eat through batteries so it's not really a design flaw.  Lately I've been looking at other drills again just to see how far behind the times this one has fallen since my batteries need replacing.  Well, I'm not really seeing anything that is bowling me over so I think I'm going to buck up and buy two new replacement batteries and check again in five years to see how much the technology has improved.",

        "reviewText": "This is my first cordless drill. I always used drills with a cord for the ample power, but for most jobs the 18V power is sufficient. Obviously the convenience of not having to plug it in anytime you want to use it is nice. You won't have to worry about tripping over any cords and you can maneuver this into tight spaces. I would say the weight balance of this drill is pretty good, but not great. After much use you can really feel the weight of the drill. The drill has plenty of torque settings for the type of job you are using it for. I have had no problems with the drill not being powerful enough. The keyless chuck is also great for fast bit changing. The trigger allows a good amount of control for drilling fast or slow. I enjoyed the bit storage on the drill and the easy switch for reverse. The battery lasts fairly long, but once the battery gets low I feel it loses a little bit of power. If you plan on using this drill during a big job then it would be a good idea to buy an extra battery to always have a fully charged battery on hand. The only concern I had compared to a corded drill was the power for drilling through tough materials. I feel this drill is much more suited for tightening and loosening screws. I liked the case the drill came in for protection and travel. The charger is as easy as plugging it an and a full charge only takes a few hours. Overall I am satisfied with this drill especially for smaller jobs. I would recommend this drill to anyone looking for a quality drill at a good price.",

The initial impression I had was good, but, as time goes on, the impression did not last. The pluses with this drill are that it has plenty of torque for driving screws into softwood. I have not tried it with any hardwood yet. There is a nice torque slip in the chuck so that you don't twist the heads off of screws (stay away from bargain screws anyway. This includes sheetrock screws for any purpose besides sheetrock.) My main gripe with this unit is short battery life and long recharge time. I was starting on an Adirondack chair and got about six screws set when it just gave up. I had let it charge overnight too. Not happy about this.I would recommend spending twice as much on a better grade. You get what you pay for. Since this was a gift, I don't feel cheated, but had I purchased this, I would be unhappily returning it.",

The Skil 2260-01 has plenty of power and I believe it will work out nicely for my purposes.The drill with battery installed is well balanced and comfortable in the hand.  The forward/neutral/reverse button is conveniently located just above the trigger and is very easy to operate.  Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase.The one drawback is the keyless chuck.  For H.D. use I cannot seem to tighten it enough to keep the bit from coming to a stop with the drill still spinning.  It is the same thing that would happen if you didn't tighten a keyed chuck sufficiently.  Thankfully, I have a good set of bits that have a somewhat triangular shaped shaft which prevents the bit from stopping with the drill running.  I would recommend a bit set like those sold for the quick-release screwdrivers/drills that have a hex-shaped shaft.The inability to tighten the keyless chuck sufficently to do heavy drilling and other high-torque jobs is why I deducted one star.  If there was a way to get the chuck to really tighten down this would be a solid 5-star product.",

Here are some actual specs:+ Drill is 8.5\" tall x 6\" long x 2\" wide.+ Carrying case is 15\" x 11\" x 4\".+ The drill with battery weighs approximately 2.5 pounds.+ The complete set, including drill, charger, both batteries and carrying case weighs about 6 pounds.+ Includes 1 standard 1/4\" phillips bit.I first used it to put together some patio furniture and it worked like a charm.  The variable speed motor minimizes your chances of over-torquing and stripping the bolt/screw heads.  The grip is very comfortable and secure.  The rubberized portion on the back grip ensures no slippage even when the sweat starts to pour.What I like the most is its very small profile for the power it delivers.  You can squeeze it into small spaces that you wouldn't be able to with other makes that have the same power.Worth the price, especially when Hitachi backs it up with a Lifetime Lithium Ion Tool Warranty, including a 2-Year Lithium Ion Battery Warranty.",

        "reviewText": "One of my favorite possessions is a DeWalt 20V Max (18V) hammer drill. It's a premium, rugged, powerful tool that can do what I need. It's one problem is it's heavy. Really heavy, and after a day of drilling holes to install a fence, my arms could barely lift it. So, there is a place for a lightweight drill, and this one certainly is. If all I need from it is to loosen screws and drill narrow holes then it can do that, easily enough.With the lack of weight, comes the lack of power. Whereas I can use a paddle bit to drill \u00be\" holes into a log with my DeWalt, and go until the battery overheats (maybe six inches deep), this drill won't go \u00bd\" into the log. Same deal with a 2\" hole saw into composite planking; this drill won't drive it more than \u00bc\" before stopping, while my DeWalt zips right through.This is not a premium tool. The case is not formfitting. The bits are sticky out of the box. The LED light goes immediately off with the trigger instead of waiting a few seconds. The battery takes care to slot into place, so you can't just casually snap it into place with the palm of your hand. The flashing pattern to indicate pre-charging is the same as the pattern for charged.  The chuck cover is cheap plastic.I'm also not a fan of tool manufactures labeling 10.8V tools as 12V, but even DeWalt did that with its 20V Max series, so I'll let it pass.The grip is nice enough, soft and a bit tactile. You can remove the belt clip, or switch it over to the other side for lefties. The included bits are a decent steel.If you need a drill for lightweight around the house use and can't afford the really good stuff, then this would be OK if you know what you are getting into. I think I'll get a lot of use out of it myself.",

It came with two lithium batteries and a charger with a nice carrying case for less than $100.00.  That is a pretty good value.  The lightness of the drill enables you to use the handy hook that accompanies it to hang it on your belt without danger of the infamous plumber's butt. (no offense to any of you plumbers, it is merely part of the tool belt culture's humor.)  A nice set of assorted screw driver bits accompanies the drill.  There may be a difference in performance between the 12 volts of this unit and the 18 volts of my older drill particularly when comparing lithium to lithium.  The old ni-cad 18 volt battery was easily twice the weight of the new 18 volt lithium.  With that said, the 12 volt Hitachi is still much lighter and easier on the wrist and shoulder, particularly on overhead work,  than the older 18 volt unit.  More power is frequently needed but for general purposes, this Hitachi should meet the needs of most people.  Contractors will probably find uses for both and if you have deep pockets by all means, invest in both 12 volt and 18 volt units.  (btw in a review of diapers recently (I have a diaper using grandchild.) I could not say I loved it, as I have never loved a diaper, however tools, sadly I can love!)",

However I have three other tools in the 10.8V series,  and I could not be happier.  One thing to note is that this is the new version of the driver/drill and impact combo. The led light has moved from below the chuck to the battery holder.  Hopefully this will decrease the shadow caused by the chuck.  Also,  these seem to come with 1.3Ah batteries and not the 1.5Ah of the previous version.  Shorter battery life is to be expected,  but it will also mean a lighter tool and shorter charging times.  If you want longer battery life and don't mind the extra weight,  get the 3Ah battery. The impact driver also has 955 inch pounds of torque compared to Makita's 800.UPDATE:Both the drill and the driver are of significantly more solid construction than the DB10DL driver (non-impact). The belt clips are an excellent upgrade from the previous model. The new position of the light on the battery holder prevents the chuck from creating a shadow over the screw you are driving.The charger is also a new model, and it takes some getting used to. The light on the previous model lit up when charging and went off when charged. The new version lights up when charging and blinks when charged.Although the batteries are not labeled as 1.3Ah, they are slimmer than the 1.5Ah batteries, so I assume they have a smaller capacity. I don't foresee the small capacity being a problem since I swap my batteries before the run flat. I could do most of the jobs around the house with my older DB10DL so i don't expect any difficulties with the new driver (10x more torque).LAst but not least, the drill and driver have soft rubber bumper pieces that prevents the tool from scratches when it is laid on a flat surface, something that was lacking in the previous model.",

The unnecessary reason for bad reviews is #1-the battery hasn`t been charged long enough  #2-the bit isn`t seated properly #3-you`re trying to do jobs that require an 18v drill. The model numbers are crucial and there can be a big difference between two of the same volts of the same brand.",

But the drills have nice power and the size of the actual drill is the best out there. Impact is powerful and the bit holder does not wobble like some other brands out there. Flashlight is the only piece that could have been made better, it's quite big and it uses regular bulb rather than led like most of other brands today. Otherwise Hitachi makes high quality tools.",

So, I bought it.And oh my gosh, it's perfect for what I need. Yes, it's a little light, a little small, not as heavy duty but it gets the job(s) done. Battery life so far has NOT been an issue. On one charge I have screwed in: 3 ikea spice racks, 6 sets of blinds, 1 curtain rod, predrilled holes for clothing lines, put together a book case, hung a dowel in the closet (predrilling and screwing).... fixed dowel in closet, etc, etc. It's still going strong!",

        "reviewText": "I like this mid-sized drill driver.  I own three Craftsman drills.  This one, a smaller 12v Nextec one and a larger hammer drill.  This is my first choice for most work.  (Like Goldilocks, not too small, not too big, but just right.  Though the other drills I own do have their benefits depending on the project).The first thing I noticed of this drill is the pleasant ergonomics.  The drill fits comfortablly in my hand.  The handle offers a nice grip and the drill is well balanced and not top heavy.  Also, There are several other nice features:- high and low settings, with 24 clearly marked torque clutch- bult-in LED light that lights up the area as one presses the trigger- holders on each side of the base for a drill bit- level on top rear for straigt drill/driving- battery level indicator on sides of handle for use with newer batteries that show level on battery stalkI would have rated the drill 5 stars except for the OEM chuck.  At times, while using, especially on heavier loads or reversing a bit out, the drill bit comes loose.  This actually led to buyer's remorse until I decided to replace the chuck with a Jacobs chuck that does a great job of keeping bits in place.  I review of the chuck can be seen here:Jacobs 31048 6000-Series 1/2-Inch Soft Grip Sleeve Keyless Drill Chuck with 1/2 to 20 Threaded MountAfter the chuck replacement, the drill driver performs as good as I had hoped in the first place.",

You can only buy 20V at the mega hardware depots.  The previous model had 2 torque settings.PROS - Not expensive.  It is 18V and works with the numerous other B&D 18V batteries I have accumulated over the years.  Great for a quick job.  Great for lightweight work.CONS - didn't have the torgue I needed to drive drywall screws into studs.  It constantly wanted to be high-speed and stripped the screw head.  Not a very powerful drill.  Not great for heavy work.  You will get frustrated over it's lack of torque.  It didn't have high RPM's either for drilling.  Sadly, it underperforms my 11yr old 18v drill.Result - this drill is lack luster and I will give to a friend or employee that could make use of it.  I ended up buying a drill from the hardware store where I could compare the various specs on torque, speed and drive ratios to deliver a higher-end service (of course with a higher-end price tag).Who should buy this?  Anyone who needs a drill for simple tasks and doesn't need torque or high speed drilling.  If you don't know what I mean then this drill is for you.Amazon posting problems - the technical specs doesn't show the torque and speed ranges.  500RPMs?  2000 RPMS?  who knows?",

        "reviewText": "I will keep this short.  I had an old B&D 18v drill that I bought some time ago (cheap) and was tired of the batteries dying on me every time I had to actually do some work.  I knew the B&D was only good for drilling picture holes on the wall and just recently, when I was faced with a big project, I realized it was time for me to graduate into the bigger and more powerful tools.  A visit to HD and LS to do serious side by side comparison only made thing worse for me, as the variety and price range was all over the place.  However, I decided that I was not quite ready for a $200+ drill and went with something inexpensive, but still delivered balanced power and quality (3 yr warranty).Upon using this drill, I am SOLD and could not believe I waited so long for such purchase.  This thing has enough power to compete with other brands that sell for 2-4 times as much.  The size, weight, and features make this a difficult drill to pass.  The added bonus is that I purchased the kit on sale with two batteries and I cannot be any happier.  Do yourself a favor and purchase it, but I recommend you look for the kit that includes the two batteries as each of them cost over $30.Please know that I will update this post if I have any issues with the drill or the batteries.",

I have used it quite a bit including being one of three hard working drivers I used when replacing my roof.  Driver for a roof you say?  Yep, if it's tile and each tile takes two screws.  So far I feel I have got my money's worth.The only hiccup along the way was that the motor burned out with a little puff of smoke.  It was easy enough to open up the drill and pull out the motor, find a generic replacement on line (very standard item used in many products) for $5 (!, $10 shipping, still a steal), and solder in the new one.  This is the only reason I docked them one star.I'll buy this drill/light/battery combo as it's cheaper than 2 batteries alone, and figure I'm good for another half-decade.",

I used it for several projects including a covered deck, bath room remodel, closet construction, and many small projects. It has performed very well, both as a drill and driving screws. We started a large project this summer and I noticed the batteries didn't hold a charge very long anymore. I looked into buying two new batteries, but soon discovered that buying a new \"kit\" was much cheaper. Now I have two good drills and don't have to keep changing from a bit to a screwdriver when piloting holes. Sure there are probably better, more powerful drills out there, but for the price, it does 90% of what I ask of it. For really tough things, I get my old, corded 1/2\" drill out.",

I have a whole shop of Ryobi cordless tools and when I saw this super cheap little drill I got it just for the few times when my other drills were left with an ongoing project (i.e., up in the attic and I didn't want to climb the ladder to get a drill for some quick little job in the garage).  I didn't expect much out of a tool this cheap and, overall, it was almost an acceptable special case little drill.  But the chuck is terrible.  I didn't intend to give up that feature in order to get the low price.  The chuck takes two hands to tighten and it doesn't stay tight sometimes.  I like Ryobi and I like cheap, but this one is just a little too cheap for me.",

I paid $101 - $25 promotion = less than the cost of the two batteries.Let me tell you about the drill. These are compact and very light weight. These are great for medium duty work. If you are going to build a deck, this is not for you. I do woodworking and weekend home improvements and these makitas have never let me down. I have drilled 1\" holes with an auger bit. That was the only time I felt I needed extra power but I still made it through. These also have an led light to illuminate your work. The grip is rubberized and ergonomic. The holster fits through a belt letting you have quick access to your driver. I don't know how many times I've wasted time looking for where I set my driver down in the past.If you try adding up the items separately you will see this is a great deal.",

I do minor repairs and maintenance work around home, take on a project here and there, and have used several other brands of cordless drill/drivers over the years. This drill/driver is a beast! It's got a good amount of torque. So far, I have built a desk, a chicken coop, installed blinds throughout the house, and performed many other minor tasks with this and it's been a joy to use. It's ergonomic, feeling light and balanced in my hands, even when driving screws over my head. The batteries have a decent life (these are the 1.3Ah batts) and charge quickly enough that I can't run one down while trying before the other's charged up.Pros: Plenty of torque for most projects. Variable speed based on trigger pressure (awesome feature), batteries last through plenty of work and charge quickly, very well balanced, ergonomic tool. The LED light comes in handy sometimes. The brake is almost instant.Cons: Most of the time, the LED light is pretty useless. The chuck is plastic, but that mostly won't be an issue for my usage.I would recommend this model to any home owner. It is so light, but quite powerful and has batteries that will impress users who aren't using it constantly to drive long fasteners. Contractors and handymen with larger projects would probably want the larger Ah battery packs - a two pack of 4Ah, which is almost 3x the power of the slim packs is available on Amazon). This model has also been updated as the DDS-181-02. The new model comes with the updated 1.5Ah slip-pack batteries and a better looking box.",

I like many, invested in a new drill simply because a new drill comes with two new batteries and case.I like this this drill; it's a bit lighter and smaller than my old one and I like the LED light.  What I don't like is the crummy case.  As another reviewer stated, there is no storage for screwdriver & drill bits.  I simply put my new unit in the old case with my old drill as a back-up in the case supplied.  My batteries work fine.Strange with complaints of this item from DeWalt - poorly designed case, bad batteries, alleged refurbished units, etc.  I guess an email to DeWalt is in order...",

Since it's out of the return policy on Amazon, I was forced to call their toll-free support line. The lady on the phone told me I have to drive it to a service center to have them check it out before they replace it. The problem is that the nearest service center is over an hour away and about $10 worth of tolls! When I asked other methods of handling this she said I could mail it to them but would have to pay for shipping.DeWalt makes a good product, but their customer service is horrible! Because of that reason, I am going to scratch this brand off of any future product purchases.",

I use it in a industrial plant and as of now its done as good as a overpriced dewalt. I am thinking of buying one for the house and getting rid of the black and decker whitch still works just half to charge a battery every time I need it.  This is one thing I have liked about this drill. I charged both batteries and the first one ran a month, not using it all day everyday.  I used it a little one day then went to night shift for 3 weeks. Got back on days started using it for a job and it finally ran out 3 days later. That was using it for a drill with 3 inch hole saw threw plywood drilling 3/8 holes in metal wire way with a step bit. A 3/4 socket for taking out a lot of bolts from a explosion proof breaker panel.  Using it to drill stainless steal boxes ( with a step bit). And a few little projects in the yard. I am very impressed.  As of now its a great buy.",

The torque and RPM speed are also much better than my other 18V. drills. Also it comes with two 18V li-ion batteries. My more expensive drills only came with one!  I don't think it can be beaten as far as the quality for the price. This drill feels more solidly built than my Porter Cable, Ryobi, and Rockwell drills.(All of them are 18VLi-ion.) I couldn't be happier, I recommend it. If your looking, Get it! Bostich really hit the mark with this one, and I don't think you will be disappointed!",

        "reviewText": "Cons:None to date.After years of cheap tools, it was time to upgrade the quality of my shop tools.  I got a Dewalt table saw and really liked it so I thought I'd try their hand tools.  This drill is my first DeWalt Hand tool and has not disappointed me an any way to date.The came in a sturdy carrying case with a spare battery and charger.  Once charged I gave it a few  trials.  It easily dealt with hardwood with bits up to 1 inch.  It was also up to handling hole saws up to 2 inches though this appears to be about the upper limit of it's torque capability.  The low speed range is exactly right for jobs requiring a delicate touch for control.  The drill also has an adjustable clutch torque control which I haven't had much chance to try out to date but which should be useful for screw driving.  Note that the keyless chuck is a big improvement over what I have encountered on less expensive drills.  And this drill has a solid, professional feel.In summary, there are bigger, more powerful drills out there but this is a solid, professional tool and seems ideal for my light to moderate general duty use.",

But then I went to use it just after Christmas this year and the battery would not charge. The charger said that it was fully charged but after an hour on the charger there was enough for one pathetic 5 second burst. Went to Sears and they were unable to help because craftsman only guarantees 1 yr on power tools.I have researched this drill since then and have found that these batteries are infamous for having this problem. Instead of sinking more money into potentially defective batteries, I have decided to go with a better Bosch drill.If you are thinking of this, I would check out the Black & Decker LDX120SB 20V MAX Lithium Ion Drill on Lowe's website. Much better drill, same price range.",

The price I paid for the used kit was less than the price for a new Li-ion batt.Just for fun I put a 'dead' Ni-cad battery on the new charger and it began to charge. After a few minutes I moved it over to the 1-hour charger and it fully charged!!! The new charger (model CH-2021) may also revive some of your old 19.2v. Ni-cads.What a deal. I recommend getting the used kit from Back Alley Discount if they have any more.",

Its superbly balanced, impressivly lighter than anything... feels like a 12 volt. Very high RPM's on high, and beacoup torque on low. Battery lasts well, but not the best Bosch battery ever, still 4-5 stars for the battery. Case gets 5*. Ergonomic design, room for tape, bits, without placing everything in a perfect position. One suggestion: angle the light upwards a bit so it lines up with the bit at a few inches. Also have not propped it yet, so I dont know how it compares to taking a beating like a DeWalt and old Swiss Bosch (This one is China, but they must have some good tooling and designs, because this is top class).",

What every review fails to mention is the tools longevity or durability.  My only critique and it is a big one is with the trigger breaking. I've purchased (3) 18 volt tools on Amazon.com: (2) 1/2\" drills and a reciprocating saw. They all worked exeptionaly well for several months of regular use.with-in under a years time, all of them stopped working due to the trigger electronics failing! what adds 'insult to injury' is the $70 price for a replacement trigger. I've replaced two triggers, but refused to buy another after the replacement trigger also failed. i will not purchase another Dewalt cordless tool again. i feel that they are cutting quality in place of profit. this is my observation on durabilty which should be a large consideration when buying any power tool. i am a repairman/carpenter buy trade (+25 years) and rely heavily on my tools for a living.",

The inner workings were really cheap (plastic) and I am surprised it lasted as long as it did.  I figured I would just put the cost of a new chuck towards this drill since it was pretty reasonable (gone up a lot since I bought it!!!!) and I am glad I did.  This drill has a lot more metal in the chuck and seems to be much better built.  Don't get too excited about the hammer drill option, its not really much, but I guess it would do a small hole in mortar.",

        "reviewText": "I'm new to power tools, so I was very excited to get this Bosch drill/driver.  My husband was excited too, because he's used power tools a LOT and says that Bosch is a good brand.  I had intended to keep this drill under the sink for me to use on odd occasions when I need to drill a hole or put something together, but my husband quickly cabbaged onto it.  He has a heavy-duty corded drill, but his cordless conked out years ago and he'd never gotten around to getting another.  Now he uses this thing all the time because it is SO much more convenient than his corded drill for small jobs.  I think he looks for excuses to drill holes in things.But this drill is actually capable of bigger jobs.  We recently had a lot of flooding here in Colorado, and my husband went to help a co-worker who had heavy damage to his home.  The power was out, so having a cordless drill/driver was crucial.  My husband was impressed with how long the battery lasted and that the drill didn't bog down even when drilling very big holes using a spade bit.  When the battery finally died, he charged it in the car while they did other work, then he was able to use it again.  In situations like this, having a cordless drill is priceless.For me, I really like that the drill comes with its own carrying pouch so I can keep everything together.  It is sturdy and has plenty of room for the drill, the charger, and cases of bits (not included) or other supplies.  There is even a pouch for keeping the manual in.  Very thoughtful.I have small hands and a bad shoulder, but I can easily hoist this thing around.  Yes, it's heavy, but not overly so, and it's very ergonomic, so it's easy to manipulate.I also appreciate that it's not intimidating.  Without having read the directions, I picked it up and used it to tighten some loose screws on the handles of an old pot (it had been driving me crazy!).  It was easy to squeeze the trigger lightly to make the driver run slowly.  I had a very small Black & Decker power screwdriver years ago, but even though this thing is much bigger and more powerful, it was just as easy to control.  I'm so happy to have this thing!For my husband, he's delighted to have it for small jobs here and there around the house.  Things that might have sat undone for weeks until he got around to lugging out his big drill are now done as soon as he's aware of the need.  He especially likes the adjustability of the angle.  This drill can fit in spots his corded drill can't (this actually comes up a lot).  Rather than having to drill in sideways, he can get this thing into a tight spot and drill head-on.  It's also great that you can have the drill point straight out, another thing his corded drill can't do.The only thing I don't like about this drill is the light.  It just doesn't seem to shine where you need it; though, to be fair, I understand this is a universal problem with drills.  And I hate that the light goes out the instant you release the trigger.  I wish that it stayed on for a second so that you don't get a strobe-light effect when you pulse the trigger (but, again, I think this is a problem with all drills...I see it happen on all the home-improvement shows).Aside from those small issues, I love this thing!",

Of course, I have hung a few pictures and paintings that have been sitting waiting to be hung, and this was a breeze to use for that sort of thing obviously.  But those hard to reach places, for example, these awful white plastic blinds that we took down, and just left the brackets there because the screws were too tight and could not angle correctly etc.  Well, this saved the day.  Being able to position in any direction, we had 16 brackets out in no time.  Then these stupid panels in our closet we could never get to, once again, finally removed with ease.I would assume this would be a good choice for on the job and light carpentry, drywall and frames etc. But for around the house, this is perfect.  It charges quickly and keeps the charge.  I should let it run out to see how long it will last, but we got a full day's use out of it for our household needs.

        "reviewText": "I love this drill! For every day \"light to moderate\" job (ie, drilling holes, tightening screws) this is a great product. Before this product, I used B&D VersaPak drill/driver (3.6 V), while it was OK, it wasn't powerful enough for certain jobs (making a hole in a wood, etc), torque was lacking. However, this Bosch PS11-102 is clearly more powerful (12V) so you can do many \"light to moderate\" jobs with ease.[NOTE: this drill/driver is NOT INTENDED for heavy duty jobs. For those you might need to consider commercial ones]1. ENOUGH POWER: the rechargeable battery (Lithium-Ion) has 12 volt power, sufficient enough for every day chores for home or garage. I was able to fix wooden fence, cabinet, and drill a garage dry wall with ease. The torque (115 lb, max) really helps when you are drilling or tightening a thicker or harder material.2. EFFICIENT MANEUVERABILITY: 5 Position pivoting head gives you a control and comfort for harder to reach areas (I was able to drive a screw under the sink kitchen cabinet with ease, esp the corners).3. EXCELLENT DESIGN: overall design of the drill is excellent. [1] There is a led light that beams when you drill, this is a clever design that helps you when you need to work in a dark area (under the cabinet), [2] Power indicator = the drill shows you how much power you have left, so that you will know when to recharge the battery. [3] The trigger is big enough (pressed with four fingers, when you grab) so that you can easily dictate the level of power you want.4. VERY STURDY: The materials used are not flimsy. Very strong/hard plastic (tested with hammer, and dropped on the garage floor, and no damage). Really nicely built.5. NICE CARRYING CASE: Some prefer plastic case, others prefer softer canvas. This comes with softer canvas case, that can hold the drill and the charger, it also has a pocket to put the manual, and ares to store some drill bits.6. ADDITIONAL INFO: If this might be a FIRST drill you will purchase, please note that it does NOT come with any drill bit set. You need to purchase the drill bit set separately.All in all, I am very satisfied. So if you need a drill for every day job, consider this gem. Highly recommended!",

I'd have been unhappy with my purchase.As it happened, I had a small project building some stairs for the back door. So I made sure this was charged up and went to work. About half a dozen screws later, the battery was zapped. I fully charged it again and used it the next day when I continued work on the stairs. Same results.The pictures for the product show it being used in mostly light weight situations - except for that one showing them using it on a wall stud. Dunno. Maybe the battery is defective or the drill is defective? It wasn't my first thought but I see a one star review where they guy got a defective drill, returned it for replacement and the second one was defective too.I ended up finishing the job I was doing with a regular corded DeWalt $30 drill.Save some money and just buy an impact driver :\u00a0PORTER-CABLE PCL120IDC-2 12-Volt MAX Compact Lithium-Ion 1/4-Inch Hex Impact Driver",

But don't buy this only for the small headlight that guides your work in dark corners. Good idea but the implementation is a little weak.The weight of the unit is just heavy enough to let you know you are using a real \"man's\" tool without being too heavy to get the job done. This unit has a forward, pause, and backward button. It also has 17 torque/speed settings for each of first and second gear. It comes with two batteries and a charger. The standard, heavy duty Dewalt carrying case completes the package.And saving the best for last, this little baby comes standard in the home team colors of black & gold representing the 6-time superbowl champion Pittsburgh Steelers.

I had purchased my first HITACHI DRILL in 2008 and the DV 20VB2 Hammer Drill had already sold me on HITACHI power tools! When I saw this DS18DVF3 Hitachi Drill/Driver Kit and all that was included for this unbelievable price, I was on this deal like \"White on a Wedding Cake.\" The Drill/Driver Kit arrived in it's own molded carrying case and the pieces included are well-made and they have performed quite well already on home improvement projects! The drill itself has one of the most comfortable 'GRIPS' I have used on a drill and the drill's performance & features are just as powerful, sturdy & efficiently placed on the drill as I would expect. The charger is fast and quiet unlike the one that came with my older RIGID Cordless Drill that I still use. The light is very powerful and the case is well laid out and easy to store. I especially love the quick design of the chuck on this drill and the bit storage on the base of the drill. I also purchased the HITACHI Drill Bit Assortment in the zipper/folding carrying case and the bits in this assortment work extremely well with this Hitachi drill. I am very pleased with this Drill/Driver Kit and would recommend it without reservation. This drill is for standard to medium use applications so if you are needing more power for heavy applications, such as masonry/steel, you should look to the bigger Hitachi Drills.",

It gets stuck in-between the gears which leads to an unsettling grinding sound.  If I just leave it in gear 1 it works fine though.  This started right out of the box brand new and unfortunately has led to a general lack of confidence in the tool.  Otherwise it is great.  Nice bright LED light, tons of power and even the compact batteries last a long time.  Very comfortable grip and smooth trigger as well.",

This caused the tip of the drill bit to wobble back and forth as it spun.w/ a 3 inch long paddle bit there was almost an 1/8 of side-to-side movement in the tip as it spun around!  I thought it was the bit at first but I tried a couple.  It's so bad you can even see the up and down movement in the chuck if you look close as it spinsTrying to drill with it caused the entire drill to shake violently as the tip was forced to stay in one place and the drill shook back and forth instead.Very dangerous my wrist still hurts.Anything longer then a screw driver bit is essentially unusable.I would say this is a design flaw in the way the attachment tips work - the only thing they really had to get right to make a drill was the shaft alignment and they totally screwed it up.Thank you amazon for making returns easy!

I did a lot of research, and narrowed it down to a few models. The L-BOXX system is interesting, but I'm not a contractor, so I chose a hammer option over the fancy case.I just got the drill last night, charged the batteries and gave it a test run. Screws into some old pine scrap went smoothly, and the clutch is easy to set for consistent depth. Drilling was fine, and I didn't see any wobble to the chuck. I tried the hammer drill, but wood really isn't a good test. I don't expect to use it that often, but it'll be very handy when I need to drill into cinder block or concrete.The drill itself is a little bigger than I expected, but fits my hand comfortably, and is balanced well. Mine came with 2.0 amp batteries, and a sticker to that effect on the outer box, which was a nice surprise. The charger is basic, but worked fine and didn't get too warm after charging both packs to full. It does use balancing leads to address each cell in the pack individually, so battery life should be maximized, and a bad cell should trigger a warning, not vent with flame. Printing on the packs lists \"INR\", which is a high-current chemistry, so I'd expect plenty of life from both batteries, especially with the protection circuit. Li-ion batteries are different enough from Nicads and NiMHs that I want to see some engineering to that effect. Bosch has done well in that regard.",

The battery lasts a long time and stays charged. The torque is great for just about any job in the house. The ergonomics is superb, and it's just easy to use. If Steve Jobs were alive he'd use this, and he'll say \"it just works\".If you're looking for a drill that'll last: get this. Forget Black & Decker, DeWalt, Milwakee, or any other brands out there at Home Depot or Lowes, this is the drill you've been looking for.",

It does what you would expect.  As an aspiring weekend DIYer, my cordless drill/driver is a fundamental tool.  The hammer mode is something that I would like to have if needed, but I would not want to spend money on a dedicated hammer drill.  So, this drill is close to ideal for suiting my needs.  I did test the hammer mode by drilling through a cinder block, and the drill performed fine.Minor gripe:  No inherent way to mount a clip to hang off your belt.  I'll have to get creative to figure out a way to carry it hands-free without a holster.  Then again, on the rare occasion that I need to climb a ladder with the drill, a cheap holster doesn't sound too bad.I hope/expect that this drill will be the last drill that I purchase for quite a while.",

I needed another battery powered drill like a hole in the head, but I figured  I'd get some use from the impact driver anyway.  I've been very pleasantly surprised by the quality of both tools, and have used them both quite a lot lately.  They're light weight and compact but still have plenty of power.

The batteries seem to have good life, Ive use them every day for two weeks at work and haven't had to charge one yet, maybe an hour each day total continuous use.Personally, for the money, I would buy Rigid 18volt or 12volt (depending on the physical size of the tools you prefer) impact and drill/driver sets for $100.They offer a lifetime warranty on batteries, as Rockwell does, but a lifetime warranty on the tools themselves also.

A built-in light focused on the work?  There it is!Best of all the 18v retains the features that have made my 9.6v a keeper even as higher voltage/higher torque brands became available: 1) Compact size: It gets into tight spaces others can not.  2) Light weight: 3 pounds compared to 6 pounds for Dewalt's 18v.I am not going to buy myself a new 18v Makita drill as I plan to take my 9.6v to my grave.

When you receive the drill, make sure there isn't any chuck wobble. I've had to exchange one due to this. Also, the product is shipped in its case without any padding, so the drill and included screwdriver bit tends to bounce around.Comparisons to the older model charger and drill:The updated charger (DC18RC) is now smaller and lighter, a definite bonus. It charges super fast like the older model (DC18RA), but still has an annoying blinking light when plugged in doing nothing.The updated drill/driver (LXFD01) has a different grip with more synthetic rubber, slightly less weight (3.3 vs. 3.5 lbs), and the same torque as the discontinued BDF452.",

As my title states;  you can buy this drill set for $99.00 at The Home Depot all the time.  $99.00 is the normal price of this drill set.2. I've never seen any Makita power tools that are \"new in box\" go on sale. (I think they just don't do sales)3. Makita makes very good tools.  They have smart and well made products that are at times more desired because they are lighter in weight.4. Though very durable, they are not as often used by professionals as the heavier duty brands (Milwaukee and Bosch)5. Though many Dewalt and Makita owners WILL argue, Makita and Dewalt tools are on average equal in quality and design features.6. I am not a pro ANYTHING.  I am just a DIY/Home project kinda guy who does a lot of research.Okay, now for the review of this drill set.1. Consumer Reports gave it top marks in performance and said it is the lightest of the top brand drills. (This sold me)2. The drill has a LED light that is incredibly helpful all the time. I wasn't sure how helpful it would be, but IT IS!! (my favorite feature)3. The battery charge is very fast.  But the black charger that it comes with is the lower-end charger they sell.  The turquoise colored charger is better.4. The case is decent but only fits the drill. (not the charger)5. The darn thing just feels well-made!I think it's important for people to understand that this drill is made for drilling holes with smaller drill bits. I broke my first drill because I used it to drive a ton of screws and drill large holes which put a large amount of stress on the drill and the chuck(part that tightens over drill bit) broke.So for drilling you need a drill.  And for driving screws you need a.....wait for it.......DRIVER!! This is a similar hand held tool that is often sold in a set along with a drill.  It spins like a drill but also creates a 'hammering\" or \"impact\" affect. Its very important that you know the difference.  In my opinion, if your willing to spend the money on a \"high-end\" drill, you should just buy the drill/driver set.  It's less expensive to buy them together.  Besides, the drill/driver set comes with the turquoise charger and 2 batteries. ($80.00 each)Makita LCT300W 18-Volt Compact Lithium-Ion Cordless 3-Piece Combo Kit",

        "reviewText": "I've owned the Bosch PS-20 10.8 Volt Pocket driver for 6 years and fell in love with it the first time I used it. While that tool is still operating like new, I wanted to try this new offering from Bosch, which is more powerful at 12 Volts, so a bit more versatile, with it's larger 3/8 inch chuck for use primarily as a lightweight drill. Once again, I was immediately impressed with the feel, solid construction and features of this drill. At only 2 pounds it feels light but very solid and substantial. Three new features stuck out that my older Bosh didn't have. Above the red trigger on the left hand side there's a battery strength indicator. Press the trigger half way and at fully charged, 3 LED's show full strength, then, 2 then one as it's depleted. It flashes when the battery is on reserve power. Not a necessity, but nice when you first pick up the tool to let you know where you stand before you go climbing up a ladder or wedge under a sink. The second noticeable feature is also small, but that the clutch is demarcated into 20 divisions instead of ten. A nice touch if you'll be repeatedly putting screws into a given material you can dial in the perfect torque not to snap a finer screw head or countersink it too deeply, say, in a soft wood.  The drill setting is almost another full quarter turn soas not to inadvertently dial the wrong setting.  As other models, this has the white LED light that illuminates the drill area when you press the trigger.  The trigger is graduated and variable speed.  A red switch on top of the tool can be moved at number 1 or 2 to select high speed or low speed.  The rotation direction selector button is larger and more pronounced than previous models making it easily engaged or reversed and direction is clearly indicated with distinct arrows.  The chuck is auto lock and operates very smoothly and precisely.  Another small but very nice addition to this model is a small \"holder\" that can be mounted onto the back of the tool and attaches with one small screw that holds four more bits. Very useful if you find you've been using a Phillips head all day but one oddball screw needs a straight slot head, you don't need to schlep around to retrieve it, it's right there with you. That same mounting point on the back of the drill can also accommodate the belt carrying clip, separately or in conjunction with the tip holder. Nice. well designed tidbit. The tool comes with two Lithium Ion batteries and charger.  Lithium Ion batteries, of course, can be charged at any level of charge without weakening the capacity of the batteries. The charger quick charges the batteries so with two, you'll rarely need to wait or not have a charged battery.  Like it's predecessor, the drill comes with a quality and durable carrying case.  Very impressed with my new tool and I can highly recommend it and expect many years of solid service I've come to know from Bosch..",

Chuck up a thin bit or try to drive a screw and you can tell things were not aligned properly.  I even chucked up a very fine art pen I have and it drew a ~1mm circle at whatever distance it was to the front of the pen.  My final check was a \"poor man's\" dial gauge.  Solidly mounted the drill and ran a pencil onto the metal rotating portion of the chuck as I ran the drill... The markings were very evident that one side of the chuck was hitting pencil as it turned but the other did not.  Like I said, I didn't have a dial gauge to quantify the runout but these few checks were plenty to know that something was amiss.I would have expected better QC from Dewalt... perhaps this amount of runout is what they deem acceptable for this drill??  Perhaps these were all from a bad lot??  They were each built in the 40-49th week run of 2011 according to the imprinted lettering beneath the battery.Other than that the drill feels great in the hand so I'm disappointed I couldn't get one that was satisfactory.",

My 30 year old Panasonic that I loved finally died and I went looking for a replacement.  Although not as compact, this B&D is perfect for my needs, both for small detailed work and heavier projects such as drilling holes in masonry. The battery holds up for much longer than I expected and provides power for most projects around the house and car.I would have preferred a keyed chuck, but the hand held chuck seems to work fine for what I use it for.  I've drilled numerous holes in concrete, done large fencing jobs, drilled through thick steel and damp wood with large bits, and this drill handled it well.It also works well as a power driver and the clip on dril bit is a handy feature.The bonus battery and bag make this an exceptional deal.",

If you are working on a job that would require frequent and repetitive use, you should consider a spare battery. For just household use, it's good just the way it is. Black & Decker is a household name but doesn't quite have the reputation of Makita, Dewalt or Milwaukie. If you dig around enough, you'll find that Black & Decker owns Dewalt so it's a safe assumption that they are very close to one another regarding quality.",

Even with replacement batteries on full charge, I couldn't do much before the battery died. This B&D has the torque and the battery life I've  wanted for years. The batteries charge fairly quickly and fit 2 other B&D power tools I have so I can easily interchange them. I've used it several times since it arrived and I'm still on the first charging of the battery!! There is a place on the unit for the screwdriver bit that is included. The torque is adjustable over a wide range depending on use...and that is easy to set! Definitely one of the best cordless power tools I've ever bought!",

I wanted to get myself a cordless drill and I asked a friend who is an independant contractor what he thought about this drill. I asked him because I saw he was using it when renovating my basement and he didn't use  (or have ) any other drills.He said he was very happy with it and he had used it in many different applications in his work. He said it was dependable, strudy,powerful and held a charge well.I wen't out and bought one on sale @ Home Depot. I strongly suggest purchasing with a battery unless you already have a battery that fits. Wait for a nice sale and grab one. You will be pleased.My experience with this drill mirrors all the claims my friend made. It's been a good friend to me...LOL",

This drill handled it without a problem and still had some charge left at the end of the day.  It's comfortable to hold and is way lighter than \"full-size\" 12V drills, but still has plenty of power for most small projects.The only thing I found a bit counter-intuitive was that the LED worklight (which is very convenient)  stays on for about 4 seconds after you release the trigger.

Anyway, I did some on line research and this one seemed to come up as the clear leader.  Metal chuck and a serious warranty probably means I won't have to worry.  One thing that I didn't like - but it's just me - is the little belt clip - it can be attached to either side of the drill, but for me, I would be afraid that it would start scratching/marring the surface of whatever I lay the drill on when assembling something.  I am not a contractor, just a home woodworking shop guy, and I tend to build \"fine\" things rather than construction things.  Anyway, it's no big deal, the belt clip is held on with a real screw into a real brass insert and you can just remove it if you have the same concerns as I did.Extra battery means that I will never be waiting for a charge too.",

The charger gave up the ghost so I checked on Amazon for a replacement charger which was shown for $19 and change. The picture of the charger was exactly the same as mine. Then right below that was the whole set, drill, charger and extra battery for only $26 and change. That was a no brainer. By buying the set for little more than the charger I would have two drills, three batteries and a charger. The set came and when I opened it the battery has a square post which goes into the charger. Of course so does the drill have the same square receptacle so my original batteries won't fit into the charger and vise versa. Why did they change the shape of the battery. Makita did the same thing. So, now I need to buy yet another charger if it is in fact the oval receptacle as shown on the Amazon site, rather than the new smaller square one. Why? Very disapointing. The dirll is a very good one, but it doesn't help me charge my previous one. If it wasn't broken, why did they change it.",

My voltage meter reads that the battery is fully charged, but it only has a minimal charge and will only weakly power the drill a minute or so between charges. I notified e-source the same day as I received the drill and received an email the next day informing me that they would send a return mailing label in a couple of days.  After one week I again contacted e-source, and after a couple of days I received another email informing me that their ability to provide a return label was not currently available, and I should print the label and take it to the Post Office and that I would have to pay the postage.  They informed me that they would reimburse me but  only for standard shipping cost and it should be about $14-15 dollars.  The postal Annex said that the cheapest would be $26.00.  I decided that it was not worth it for me to put out $26.00 up front  and then hope I would be reimbursed.  I bought this item of equipment because of its name and the price.  The price was a concern as it was too cheap.  I knew better but  I know that the Kawasaki company has been around since 1906 and has, at least, in the past been known for making quality equipment.  This company may be a large  international corporation with a Japanese name, but this item of equipment is made in China.  I have nothing against the Chinese but there track record has not been the best.  A lot of reviews at Amazon and other sites indicate to me that  Quality control has apparently been lacking in the making of  the batteries.",

My former drill had a long chuck. This one is short, so the over-all length of the drill body and chuck is a nice size. The balance feels good in my hand. There is plenty of power for drilling wood; I have not had to drill through metal. The speed control is excellent and is finely controlled. The battery charge lasted what I thought was a long time.I didn't want to pay this much for a drill, but this is high quality. The light is bright and can tilt slightly down to straight up. The charging unit is smaller that what I previously had, so I'm pleased with that. This drill and light come with 2 batteries. Watch out when buying a drill because some come with only 1 battery. Then what do you do when the battery runs out of power? With this drill kit you have another battery. The Lithium Ion battery is nice, and won't have a reduced charge because of not fully discharging between charges. I'm very pleased with the combination of items, materials, and features for the price.",

        "reviewText": "Purchased this for father's day in June and have put the drill through the paces with some handyman work and remodeling around the house. The battery lasts a long while . . . I was doing small projects (installing doorknobs, hanging picture frames, installing curtain rods, etc.) off and on and didn't have to charge the battery for a couple of weeks. Pretty COOL, HOMEBOY. I built a rack in my workshop out of pressure treated 4x4's, including boring some 1\" and 1 1/2\" holes for pipe to fit into and fastening some 2x4's with 3\" deck screws into the 4x4's. It had some trouble on the last 1/2\" of driving, but c'mon, they're 3\" deck screws going into pressure treated 4x4's, cut it some slack! It still handled the job nicely.Overall, this is an entry level priced drill aimed at the DIYer but far exceeds those expectations. It's not going to be as durable or hardcore as a Milwaukee, and I certainly wouldn't expect or recommend a contractor to use this day in and day out on the job site, but for the average to above average husband handyman like myself, it passes nobly with flying colors . . . extravagant, rainbow-like flying colors. I have absolutely loved the drill (bout to test out the driver with some concrete anchors in a slab!) and don't know how I've gone so long dragging around my corded Dewalt and extension cord everywhere. How foolish of me! The ease of changing bits, selecting different torques, having two speeds to choose from, the portability, balance, and weight, the comfort of the grip, and the compactness of the drill are all so delightful. I've really enjoyed using this little bloke and look forward to many more moons of use out of it!My one gripe that others have voiced is the ill-advised location of the light that comes on when you press the trigger. I don't know what goofball cleared that during R&D, but it would've been a whole lot nicer if it was another 1/2\" down so that the shadow cast by the chuck isn't on the EXACT SPOT you're trying to illuminate! The silly guys at Porter Cable will have to fix this next time, but I won't hold it against them this time, because they crafted quite a nice product that's a real pleasure to use.",

I am a commercial plumber/fitter, I have always used a Ridgid heavy duty corded drill, this little guy really takes the cake for me, it will drive screws all day, I put 3 inch screws to hold shower body valves in place, screw down pipe hangers, I even drilled a saddle into 2\" cast iron fire sprinkler lines with it. I bought it on a whim, I wanted a Milwaukee m12 drill/driver but I got a deal on this one slightly used for 48 bux shipped and couldn't pass it up. Bottom line it's a great product more powerful than my older 18v nicads and it lasts longer. Also your battery will recharge in 15-30 mins so you won't be held up with downtime.",

Total job time about 10 hours over 2 days. I was able to finish 95% of that on one charge. Lost juice with about 5 drawers left. Comes with two batteries, so no lost time. Plugged in the spent battery in the charger as I plugged in the spare and continued working.  Battery was fully charged within 30 min. Drill is light, has a helpful light, plenty of power and control. Did a few overhead drawers and it's light enough that you're not staining much.  Would be nice if they made the screwdriver bit magnetic to grab onto screws.  But the bit is meant to store on the top of the drill on a magnet built into the drill.  Overall great drill.

        "reviewText": "I bought this drill from my workplace new (Sears) about a few months ago and I am overall pleased with it. I got it for $99 with an extended replacement plan given DeWalt's reputation for being rough with their warranties. That being said, I think this drill kit is good for someone who either wants a stronger drill for home use or for someone running a small machine shop. It does have its limits; I do NOT recommend this drill for any sort of masonry work due to it being too weak for the job (I tried it myself and it doesn't have the torque or power to do the job). Also, if you're drilling through metal, don't go with anything thicker than 1 cm (1/2 inch) or any drill bit thicker than 1 cm (1/2 inch). Any other material, don't go more than 25 mm (1 inch) for the drill bit or 10 cm (4 inches) for the material you're working on.The kit comes with a charger and two NiCad batteries. The NiCad batteries that come with this set will be slightly more stronger than most of the batteries in other sets due to the higher amperage (batteries are made in Japan...stick with rechargeables made in Japan if you can). Most of the store branded power tools you find (Craftsman/Kobalt/Husky) are mostly for homeowner use and can't take the loads or strains of anything more than light/medium duty work.Pros:Two batteries come with the kitKeyless chuckLight for an 18 volt drillCarrying case is well laid outGood power and ergonomicsSomewhat affordableLarge line of DeWalt add ons for this Battery configuration (Circular saw, reciprocator, etc)Cons:Uses NiCad batteries. NiCads until recently did have a much longer lifespan vs. Lithium batteries but don't have the power and battery time of a comparable Li Ion. These Dewalt NiCads won't have the power of a similar Li Ion battery!Chuck sometimes loosens upSettings for torque aren't labeled well.This drill kit runs cheap because it's likely that DeWalt probably is discontinuing this type of tool line overall. If you are in the market for a beginner drill kit that is more powerful than a homeowner kit, I'd recommend this one.",

Love the power indicator and lighted speed indicator for screws or drilling.  The light is on the base and works adequately but the Porter-Cable design is better (under the drill chuck and much brighter).  I purchase this drill so I would not have to keep switching from bits for screws to drill bits when needing to make pilot holes.  Even though I love my Porter-Cable, because of the size and weight convenience of this drill, it will be my number one drill now.  Several years ago, I purchased a 12 volt Black and Decker drill that was quite disappointing.  This one seems much better build quality.  Time will tell.  The Porter-Cable is about 3 years old and still works like new after many projects.  Let's see if this new drill can do the same!Update: The power level hasn't budged in 3 months after using this drill several times on light projects (I still haven't charged it beyond the charge it came with.)  I'm not loving the self-sensing technology.  I like the clutching system of other drills better.  Other than that, because it is so light and small, this is my \"go to\" drill and I love it!!!!Update: Well, after having this drill and using it quite a few times, the power level finally went down to one bar after removing several 3 inch screws and several projects since last posting.  This drill amazes me!  By far the best drill I have ever owned.  I just wish it didn't have the \"auto-sensing\" feature, which really does not work on my drill.  Love the light weight and the smooth action.",

The most recent project was simply to drill 2 holes in the side of my kitchen trash can to alleviate the trash bag from sticking to the sides of the container when I put a new one in and when I'm filling it with trash. I think it was a tip I found on lifehacker.The drill is powerful and has a good weight. My only issue is the size of the grip where you hold the drill. That's because it's a bit too large for me. Having said that, I'm certainly not the drill's target audience, and I'm sure extensive research went into determining a good size for the target audience. Since my hands are a bit smaller than the average man's hands, I expected it to be a little too big. But that's not B&D's fault.The drill is powerful.It comes with 2 batteries and they are supposed to last a very long time betweeen uses.

Wouldn't you know it--about a week later, we noticed some of the floor boards on our deck were cupping and needed to be replaced. The one-battery drill did a good job, but it clearly wasn't up to the task--the battery needed 3x charges to get through the day's work.The Black & Decker BDCDHP220SB-2 20v \"Max Lithium\" Kit includes TWO of B&D's highly regarded 20v lithium batteries, and after using my new drill for several weeks' worth of quick fixes and all-day projects, I am completely sold on the need for a two-battery configuration. Yeah, you can always buy a second battery, but the spare will set you back around $40 (and that doesn't include a spare charger)--so why not just grab the two-battery kit and make life a little easier when it comes time to do a serious day's worth of drilling.(Aside from the battery thing, this is a terrific drill--the ergonomics are as good as it gets, and the amount of torque produced by the motor is quite impressive indeed. I'm a big fan of B&Ds new cordless tool line, and this particular drill is the flagship model and is worth every penny.)",

It's so nice to be able to just use this drill knowing that if it powers down, I can just insert the other battery and keep going. With the old drill, if it quit, I'd have to go find the corded drill and a drop cord and get everything plugged in before I could continue.This did seem a bit heavy to me but it feels significantly lighter than the corded drill we have plus you don't have that cord \"drag\" feeling. Despite feeling slightly heavy, it feels balanced and the grip part is skinny enough that it was still fairly comfortable for me to use.I never switched out any drill bits but I watched my hubby and it seemed pretty easy.I've used more tools since we've been renovating our house than I probably have the entire rest of my life. I hope this is not a trend for me. You want to install flooring, wallpaper, paint, tile then I'm your girl. Power tools are not my thing but if I do have a need for one then this is one of my favorites.Thank you to Amazon and the Maker/Vendor of this drill for giving me the opportunity to try it out.",

Having a second battery is nice to have especially when it's free but I've yet to take advantage of it.  This model charges fast and doesn't slow down for hours.

Perhaps a tad heavy for certain tasks, could produce are fatigue.  Overall, a tremendous value when compared to the competition.  Highly recommended.",

        "reviewText": "I like to beat up my tools and I expect them to last a long time.  I do not upgrade my tools unless I have to.  Before this drill I had (have) 2 Makitas; one is a 15 year old 3/8\" corded, and the other is a 12 year old cordless Ni-MH. I have been looking for a replacement for the cordless drill because the Ni-MH replacement batteries are too expensive.  I have been interested in trying out a Lithium drill because of their lighter weight and longer battery life, so I was pleased to put the BDCDHP220SB-2 through some tests (I also tested the LDX220SB which is cheaper, but less powerful).All the tests here are done with fully charged batteries on a redwood 4x4. I wanted to see where the limits were with the drill.Tests:1. Drill 100 holes with 3/8\" bit - This was an easy test that I expected the drill to pass, and it did no problem.2. Drive 50 2 1/2\" Drywall Screws - Once again the drill had no problem performing this task (although by now my hand was getting tired).3. Spade bit test (Irwin Speedbor w/blue groove)- I now wanted to see what would be the largest spade bit I could use to drill a hole through the 4x4. I started with a 7/8 bit and drilled a half dozen holes through the 4x4 with ease.  I did notice on the lower #1 setting I had to lighten up on the amount of force I used. But, the #2 setting on the drill performed this with ease.  I again tried this with a 1\" spade and the drill performed well.  Finally, I went for broke and tried a 1 1/2 spade; this is where I had problems. I definitely reached the limits of the drills 412 in-lbs of torque.  I was only able to drill in about 1/8\".  I suppose I could have gently nursed my way through the wood, but showed me I had reached the limit.All the tests were performed on the same battery charge and the drill felt comfortable and well balanced.  Doing this with my cordless makita would have been tiresome.For heavy home use this drill won't fail.  The fact that I could easily drill through the 4x4 with a 1\" spade shows this drill has the power I need for most jobs (It is rare I need to drill with the 1 1/2\" spade I used in the test).  Also, it is a must that I have the second battery so that is a plus.If you are debating between this model and Black & Decker's LDX220SB, I would choose this one.  While it is initially more expensive, it is more powerful (the LDX220SB could only go up to a 7/8\" spade in my test) and it with a second battery, the LDX220SB does not.All in all, a great drill that I will enjoy for many years.",

        "reviewText": "After much disappointment with a portable drill many years ago, I've depended on my Craftsman Professional corded drill for my diy repairs and installations on our old house and our old rental building.  All too often, I've had to run a long extension cord to my project.  Often, the corded drill has been too large to fit into small spaces.  But, I'm stubborn; didn't want to be dependent on batteries.  However, batteries have changed for the better, so when I decided to take advantage of old flooring being replaced to screw down the creaky floorboards in a kitchen, I was very glad to have this lighter weight compact tool to secure the boards and still have charge left.  Compactness wasn't an issue in that first test, but at 8.5\" from the tip of the chuck to the back of the casing, this Black & Decker will fit spots I wouldn't be able to reach with the corded drill.  And it won't give out in the middle of a job.",

I loved my Black & Decker 18 volt hammer drill for performance but was not good on battery life.  I purchased a later model Black & Decker 20 volt Lithium Ion drill but it lacked the performance.  The 220SB-2 is the answer.  It is powerful & has a larger 1/2\" chuck sizes just like the big brother Dewalt drills.  I am so impressed that I bought two drills.  Over the past  year, I have moved from the Black & Decker 18volt world to the 20 volt Lithium world.  It has made a difference!  Besides the 220SB-s drills,  I have many other  Back & Decker 20 Volt lawn & garden tool that I use on my 5 acres.  I now have a large collection of 20 volt batteries & a quick charger... thus, I never run out of power.While I am not a pro,  I do allot of work on my land & built many project.  I feel this drill is more than enough & meets the budget that most of us \"do-it-yourselfers\" can afford!  The 220SB-2 is the best drill in the Black & Decker 20 volt line!",

Unless you are using a 2\" spade bit in rock maple, or need to be A Real Man, this drill makes far more sense than the super-duty Milwaukee and  Dewalt offerings that weigh and cost twice as much.  Its only competitor is the Mikita which is excellent, recharges super fast and is almost as comfortable to hold for long periods, however the Mikita costs $200.Two minor objections:  The batteries (two provided) take 40 minutes to charge and the sturdy plastic case does not allow for the \"extra\" battery to be attached to the flashlight or charger when in storage-rather it has a separate compartment--this and other storage voids makes for an overly-large storage size.  The makita soft-sided cube makes much more sense.",

The battery charges fast and stays charged for an extremely long time. A piece of advice is you want a second battery. The batteries are $50 and attachments are $40 (at Sears) and you can buy the cordless Bolt on for $90 when it is on sale. It makes sense to just buy another drill and you get a second battery, another drill attachment, and the actual drill and charger and are perk. Plus if someone comes over to help with a project now you will a second drill! Sorry to those who had a defective one but I recommend you exchange it for a new one and give it another try!!!!!",

She knew that my last drill was finally getting to the point where the Ni-cad batteries no longer stayed charged and it just looked abused in general. Fresh out of the box this is a great drill for the price. It's really powerful and the bolt on system works like a dream. Every single attachment is excellent and works as you would hope and expect with a nice tight fit and the power to do it's job. Now I would love to say that this ranks up there with Makita and Bosch drills, but what sets those drills apart isn't so much their functionality when brand new, it's how long they last and how much abuse they can take. So really the Bolt On system is probably priced too low to expect the motor being made of a high percentage of industrial duty steel parts, but for what it is this is a damn good drill.  The interchange system is easy and fits tight. The battery is excellent and charges quickly, the motor is powerful, and the entire assembly seems well made. Just as a drill this is an excellent tool, but as a multi functional tool system there is just no comparison in value and overall quality to compare it to anything else.",

Same tool, same specs, different name, and right now the Black and Decker model is 59 bucks. I just bought one of these craftsman and now I feel like returning it to get the cheaper Black and Decker. Why spend double plus tax in store for the same tool with different color plastic. Not to mention the handle on the Craftsman is gray and it will turn black from grease in no time while I'm using it to disassemble my motorcycle/ or truck when making repairs. I had a 14 volt craftsman impact that I was very happy with, that was all black, until somebody stole it off my front porch. I may opt for the Black and Decker just because it will stay cleaner W black handle.The only thing I don't like about it is my previous craftsman was slightly tilted at an angle and this one is straight. The molding under the trigger also has a sharp edge on it that is uncomfortable on your middle finger. It may not be noticeable with a small hand but with a larger hand it doesn't fit the same.After about 5 min I ended up taking a dremel and sanding the plastic under the trigger smooth. Again, may not be a problem with smaller hands/fingers.I also noticed Black and Decker sells an $89.00 version of this same gun along with the $59 version, not really sure what could be that different other than it appears that one says 11 position clutch the other says 10 position. One has a white trigger the other one has a black trigger, they are all 20 volt lithium.This gun is very powerful with the impact on it, almost too fast if you only need to use it for removing Light hardware even though it is variable speed. If you just need a light duty cordless drill get the 12v.Update 9/6/13Tested the impact versus a Bosch 12 volt and obviously it wasn't even close competition regarding speed , as it drove 3\" lag bolts 3xs faster. However it wasn't any stronger at actual torque than the 12 volt Bosch according to the digital torque wrench. Both impacts tightened a lug nut on my truck to 40 foot pounds and had no more power to move that lug nut,  which is about 460 inch pounds. This is a 3rd what it advertises at roughly 1500 in lbs and the Bosch advertising 930 in lbs. Neither come close to advertised tq #'s.",

However, they have become so pricey, I decided to look around some.  Found this Black & Decker.  It had some good reviews so I saved it to my wish list to await my next project.  Sure enough, the wifey wanted some sliding drawers in her lower cabinets so I made the purchase.  Glad I did!  This electric screwdriver/drill is smaller and lighter than my old Ryoki.  And seems just as powerful.  One mighty advantage -- it holds a charge much longer.  So, I don't have to worry about whether the battery is charged for a quick fix, etc.  Since you get two batteries, you never run out of power.  There may be some better, but this one is pretty good, especially for the price.",

The Skil driver I bought shot sparks out of the tool and soon died. I was not all satisfied with Skil's response to this problem. In my view, the Skil driver I had was not well made and was adequate only for occasional use. A driver is an extremely useful tool, I would highly recommend spending more and getting a professional grade tool. I spent more for a Hitachi driver, but I got a professional grade driver that will last, and gives me problem free performance,",

This drill is compact, lightweight and not in the sense of being a fragile piece of junk but in a good way. I always hated the heavier drills I've had in the past which were bulky and hard to handle while working. It has a great LED light that activates when drilling which really helps in shady to dark corners. With 2 power settings and torque adjustments this drill really has it all. comes already charged and can hold a charge for 18 months supposedly. the handling really feels like you have total control with rubber grip contours and overall design. this is a 20V lithium so it is way better than my my old 18V Ni-Cad drills. this makes a great gift and in my opinion a must have for all DIY'ers",

BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT IT SHOWS IN THE PICTURE!!!When receiving this drill I was surprised to find it only came with one battery, and only after this did I read the in product description that it only comes with one.Why was I surprised to find only one battery?BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT IT SHOWS IN THE PICTURE!!!So I began to wonder what they were thinking by selling a cordless drill with only one battery while posting an image of that same drill with two batteries!!Well here's what I came up with, and you can take this from and old crackpot like myself who's been on this earth 52 years. Now even though I wasn't exactly born yesterday I recall some time ago this old duffer telling about an old trick he learned from a car dealership, and can you guess what it's called?Well it's the old \"Bait and Switch\", that's right, and for further definition just read this folks:\"The intention of the bait-and-switch is to encourage purchases of substituted goods, making consumers satisfied with the available stock offered, as an alternative to a disappointment or inconvenience of acquiring no goods (or bait) at all, and reckoning on a seemingly partial recovery of sunk costs expended trying to obtain the bait. It suggests that the seller will not show the original product or service advertised but instead will demonstrate a more expensive product or a similar product with a higher margin.\"Now please understand that in no way is this a reflection of Bosch tools, or a critical review of the drill itself as Bosch typically surpasses my expectations, and the reviews will bear this out. My dilemma is now I really want this drill because its a good drill. But what contractor like me would ever buy a cordless drill with one battery? So rather then send it back I need to order another battery.Here's a great deal on a 2-pack for $99.00. Keep in mind this is the same type 2.0 Ah battery that come with this same drill.It's the Bosch BAT612http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DJMV2EE/ref=gno_cart_title_0?ie=UTF8&psc=1&smid=ATVPDKIKX0DERAdditionally I discovered two even higher performance batteries for this same drill;Here's the Bosch BAT620 which you can get as a 2-packhttp://www.amazon.com/Bosch-BAT620-2PK-18-volt-Lithium-Ion-Battery/dp/B00DJMV2J4/ref=pd_bxgy_hi_text_z,But wait there's more, Bosch offers a 5.0Ah battery for this same drill, but it's expensive and I'm not finding it sold as a 2-pack.It's the Bosch BAT621http://www.amazon.com/Bosch-BAT621-18-Volt-5-0Ah-Battery/dp/B00JNA173W/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1413602697&sr=8-1&keywords=Bosch+BAT621",

However, there isn't much difference in terms of power between 1st and 2nd gear, both seem to go from 0 to 1000 rather quickly. The touchy trigger makes it a little difficult slowing rotation speed when necessary. Would have given 5 stars were it not for these discrepancies.

My batteries for the Panasonic were dead so I figured why not get the \"best\".  I am totally frustrated with the Makita!  The drill is powerful (and I do like the quick charge) but does not have the feel of the Panasonic.  Additionally, I have not gotten the long battery life that I expected.  I haven't done a side by side test with both tools, but I always marveled at how long the Panasonic lasted.  The Makita chuck is good, the Panasonic is great.  More importantly, I also own the impact drill/driver from Panasonic and absolute love the tool.  Its' clutch is the best.The Makita impact driver is really trash.  It has no clutch (unbeknownst to me)...I made the assumption that it did.  It is not sensitive in the least bit and I am CONSTANTLY breaking screws.  I did realize that it is a impact driver for bits, not 1/2\" drive sockets (unlike the Panasonic).  I didn't realize how much I would miss my Panasonic.I have owned the Panasonic for at least 8 years.  There is not a single feature that I don't like about either the drill or driver.  I blew over $250 on the Makita and am not a happy camper right now.I am on Amazon because I think that I will buy another Panasonic Drill (I already have 2 drills + impact driver) because the batteries are almost the same price as the complete drill.Better buy the Panasonic.  I heard from the Makita rep at the NJ WW show that Panasonic is GOING OUT OF THE US TOOL MARKET.  When I complained to the rep about my new Makita and mentioned how much better the Panasonic is, he nodded knowingly.",

Not commonly found in stores, this drill tends to be found in the hands and toolboxes of professional craftsmen and technicians. The design is just about perfect with no useless bells and whistles and a grip that is also comfortable for users with smaller size hands.  By far the best power-to-weight ratio you can find.  The torque is nothing short of amazing and the light weight will be appreciated when performing repetitive tasks - especially overhead. The clutch is superb and the keyless chuck works much better that most.  The charge on the 3.5 amp hour battery packs goes for a LONG time after a relatively short charging period.  We have never been able to break or wear out one of these drills aside from the inevitable demise of the battery packs which are very pricey to replace - not surprising considering the 3.5 amp hour rating.  This is truly a professional grade tool that will be appreciated by any user.",

My 18V other brand finally wore out and I saw the Panasonic being used by local contractors, so I bought one.  I've built a deck, finished a large basement, and done numerous other projects on 3 houses.  Love the drill!  I've had no problems whatsoever.  The chuck is probably the best I've ever had - no slippage with drill bits.  I really like the lighter weight & the relatively compact size.  The batteries are finally beginning to lose their storage capacity after 3 years, so I just bought a  3.5 battery two-pack.  The old batteries still hold some charge, but the time is noticeably shorter than new.  The drill has quite a lot of torque for a battery model  (not as much as my Milwaukee 1/2 hole shooter of course) and is very controllable.  Batteries last a long time before recharge.  I'm sure that cold weather degrades the battery time, but for most intermittent projects, cold temps don't seem to be a problem.  I wish the plastic case had a little more room for storing bits, etc.  However a plastic tube / rubber end cap storage container fits perfectly in the case & will hold a fair number of bits.  Our local industrial supply house has sold many of these to local contractors & I've talked to a number of the guys using them daily.  So far almost everyone really likes the drill.  So do I.",

So far I haven\u2019t found anything it can\u2019t do.  The small size makes it a good fit for close quarters.  The second battery I thought was a great option, but so far I have not needed it, because the battery life is so good.",

You get what you pay for in tools, and so if you want the best, this is certainly among them.  It is compact in size, and has lots of power. The belt hook works great and will not easily slip off a belt, pocket, or tool pouch.These tools use batteries which are quick charging, and if they sit unused for an extended time period, the battery does not drain down like the older generation NiCad batteries.  This is one of the best.",

I have been very pleased with the performance and it seems to have ample power for any around the home project.  This drill comes with a Ni-Cad battery, so you need to drain it completely each time to avoid the memory problems Ni-Cads are known for.  The battery charges in 3-5 hours and my first charge reaped about one week of moderate use.  The variable speed is nice, but I wish they had built in a trigger on lock as well.  For the price I paid though, this is a great value.",

In the short period I have owned it there is no task I have undertaken that required a more powerful tool and the smaller size has enabled me to get into places my neighbor's 18v counterpart could not fit.

It's great for pre-drilling screws and other light-duty tasks around the house and shop, but you aren't going to run a hole saw with it.

For a sub-compact cordless drill, it's handled every situation I've thrown at it, w/o a problem. As a drill, it has more power than I anticipated. This is the only drill/driver in it's class to have an all-metal chuck. The first time I got that impression I needed to move some 1/2\" copper pipe and run it through a few 2\"x4\". I didn't have my V18 hammer drill and slapped a XC battery on this and w/ a 5/8 inch spade bit it bore 8 holes with no problem. It took longer to do but this M12 finished the job. I've read complaints about the chuck loosening but haven't encountered this problem yet. We're supposed to hand-tighten bits in key-less chucks drills. There's a ratcheting sound when the chuck bottoms out insuring the right grip & locking the collar in place. Some may be holding the chuck & using the trigger to tighten, that's fine but an extra twist with hand takes care of that. This tool has been more than adequate for my handyman level jobs and, like all my M12 tools, goes to every job site. If you're a DIYer you'll have this drill/driver for years. As a bare tool it's a-lot of tool in a small package, for under $100.",

        "reviewText": "I bought this to replace an aging 14 V NiCd Makita which was extremely heavy, and which made working overhead tiring. I figured I'd be losing battery life and torque moving to a smaller tool like this, but that it was a reasonable sacrifice and wouldn't matter for working in wood. I was wrong, but in a good way: this tool is no sacrifice at all. The power is phenomenal, and one thing you should consider is that if you're working overhead, a lighter tool actually will perform better than a heavy one, all things considered (i.e. same power). The reason is that without you fighting the weight, you can put more of your own strength into the drilling or driving, meaning you can more effectively use the power in the tool. For example, I found that moving to this tool meant that I had less problems with cam-out when driving wood screws for window treatments; I was able to put more force into the screw because I didn't have to fight the weight of the tool as much.The tool has an extremely solid feel to it, from the heavy trigger to the tightness of the clutch adjustment. Everything about the tool feels well-made and tight. Much different from other tools I've owned.The battery, despite it weighing virtually nothing (relative to the drill itself) has surprising capacity. In fact, despite using it for a couple of project already, I still haven't had the battery indicator drop below \"full\" indication. Couple that with a 30 minute charge, and you can really do with just owning one or two batteries. While Lithium ion batteries don't have the same kind of shelf life as NiCd batteries do, the fact that they are so light and charge so quickly makes up for this. I get much more life out of these per charge than the 14 V NiCd I was using before, and yet they are \u2153 the size and what seems like 1/10 the weight.The LED light is nice, but really only helps when starting a hole; once you start drilling the chuck quickly obscures the light.All in all, this is a really well-built tool with few flaws. In fact, the worst thing I can think to say about this drill is that the trigger lock is poorly designed, and doesn't stay in position very well. But that's it--that's pretty much the only bad thing I can think to say about this fantastic drill. I'm a very picky and critical engineer, so if I'm this happy with a tool I'm confident that most people will not be disappointed with it.",

I've used all types of drills in a wide range of voltage and power in my younger days including the best brands of today and yesterday. This drill has a speed, I believe, of about 800 rpm's, which is not in the jet engine range. It's powerful enough to easily drill through any wood, thin steel and my thigh. For the price however, it's fantastic. Don't let the 20 volts fool you though. It performs more like 12. I seriously considered getting another battery, but since they cost almost as much as the drill and my use is lightweight and not often, I declined. The drill works just fine for a low cost home tool.",

Now he's stealing mine!The power in this drill is amazing and the battery NEVER dies. If you're not familiar with the way lithium ion batteries work, make sure your battery is 100% dead before charging it. Your battery has a memory and if you charge it when it's only 3/4 dead, over time it will \"remember\" to only charge to 3/4 of the battery's capacity instead of full. I hope that makes sense in basic terms, that's how my husband explained it so I would remember it. It worked, because I never charge the battery unless it is TOTALLY dead.Anyway, this drill is a BEAST.  Whether you're a woman doing home improvement projects (and then some) or a man who really wants a drill who won't let you down, consider this drill.",

The price is right on the drill (I picked it up with a battery, charger and case for $99).  It will work fine for most people doing small to medium size stuff around the house but anything that requires a little torque or power behind it, this will not fair out too well.It looks great but thats about it, all show, no go.  I have since invested in a Dewalt 18v XRP and wont be looking back.  Does everything from small screws up to tapcons with ease.  This is just my personal opinion so take it as you want but if your looking from somthing that you wont worry about the power, spend the extra money up front and know you have a serious tool.

However, they have become so pricey, I decided to look around some.  Found this Black & Decker.  It had some good reviews so I saved it to my wish list to await my next project.  Sure enough, the wifey wanted some sliding drawers in her lower cabinets so I made the purchase.  Glad I did!  This electric screwdriver/drill is smaller and lighter than my old Ryoki.  And seems just as powerful.  One mighty advantage -- it holds a charge much longer.  So, I don't have to worry about whether the battery is charged for a quick fix, etc.  Since you get two batteries, you never run out of power.

The instruction manual states it is only available on Models DCD940, DCD950, DCD960 and DCD970, which are all 18volt tools.  We haven't used the tool yet, but since a rating is required to post this notice, I will give it 4 stars based on previous satisfaction with similar DeWalt drills, but bear in mind that this is a brand new model.  I would also caution buyers to heed the battery charging guidelines.  Our only disappointment with DeWalt 14.4volt cordless tools has been with the lifespan of the batteries, which are expensive to replace.  But we may have hastened their demise by squeezing the last bit of torque out of them before recharging, and not deep charging them periodically as recommended.",

        "reviewText": "I have always had a sort of love/hate relationship with Black & Decker products.  Some of them have been great; others were not worth the trouble of taking them out of the box.  A few months ago I took a chance and purchased this Black & Decker cordless drill.  I will be honest and tell you right now that I bought this thing on sale at the local Wally World for a grand total of twenty two dollars.I purchased this drill specifically to perform minor repair jobs around the house and to build my birdhouses and wooden toys and fix things my wife wants fixed...and fixed NOW!  I can tell you right now that this drill was not made for major construction projects.  Of course I don't do major construction projects so that point is rather moot as far as I am concerned.  If you buy this thing and think you are going to get something equal to a high dollar Dewalt, Makita or Hitachi...well, you are in for a disappointment. Personally when I do talk myself into doing a major project, either from scratch or a remodeling job, I borrow industrial size power tools from either my son-in-law, grandsons, son or nephews.  Actually, truth be told, I try to talk them into doing the project for me.  At times this works out quite well. (I feel sometimes they try to avoid me - go figure). They are good lads.Anyway....This little drill fits my needs perfectly.  It has enough power to drill all the holes I need drilled and screwing in all the screws I need screwed in - and/or removed.  It dose not have the power to screw-in large and deep screws into very hard wood nor does it have the power to remove nuts and bolts of larger size that have more or less rusted tight...which seem to be a chronic happening around my place.This drill does have a variable speed which works quite nicely as well as a 24 position clutch to prevent stripping screws.  With constant use, the battery charge will last me at least one hour which is long enough for me to work anyway as I like to take frequent naps.I like the keyless chuck as I am forever loosing the things on the several drills I have that require them.  It is quite simple to change bits on this thing.  The forward and reverse button in well placed and a snap to use.  This thing comes with a DC battery charger and the battery is easy to remove and insert.This tool is relatively light which is important to me as I am getting old and feeble and find the lighter weight much more comfortable than some of the bigger and more expensive drills.Now keep in mind and let me repeat myself somewhat.  This drill will not perform like a high dollar professional or industrial drill, but that being said, you are not paying several hundred dollars for it either.  No, this is a great little drill and screwdriver to have around the house for home repairs and minor building projects.  It is well work the price they are asking for here on Amazon but I would advise that you haunt your local big box stores looking for sales...it can be had for less money if you get a bit luck.As to the longevity of this thing...well, we will just have to wait and see. I suspect that with my usage It will last quite some time, but then you never know these days.  The old saying that \"they don't make them like they use to,\" is becoming more and more valid as each year passes.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks",

I wasn't sure about this Hitachi grinder especially since it looked cumbersome to hold for grinding dogs' nails but that wasn't the case. It doesn't take long to get used to the new feel. I love the battery life - I've used this 4 times on two dogs and the battery is still going strong. The only thing I would warn about is that it has a lot of power on higher levels and if you use this higher power on dog's nails it will be uncomfortable for the dog because it will get too warm fast.",

But made the switch to the Hitachi based on the reviews here on Amazon, and I am truly glad I did.  The unit is very well balanced, has more than sufficient power, is not too loud, and the battery last!  I still have my Dremel jig on the garage workbench, but using this for around the house, and especially trimming the nails on our Great Dane, is simply invaluable.One thing I have found is the collet gets very hot during use, even short periods, making it difficult or impossible to remove bits until it cools down.  I don't like the idea of using freezing spray to cool the metal down as it can induce fractures that will eventually lead to failure, so I have to wait between bit changes.  Never had this on various Dremel models.Note also that the Amazon page shows a good add-on item is the Dremel Keyless Chuck - DOES NOT WORK on this unit so beware!  (Now I have a spare one for my Dremel ;)Still, very much recommended for portable use.",

        "reviewText": "I'm a low-volt contractor and have to drill into and mount items to: drywall, plywood, plastic, steel studs, angle iron, steel struts, solid/treated lumber, etc.. Recently a job required me to drill 1/8\" mounting holes into 4\" square covers and brackets of similar material. This drill powered right through them at first, before the battery died around the 30th hole, after which I used a colleague's 12V MAX DeWalt which was heavier, bulkier, and slower. Lest you think that indicates a poor battery life, I hadn't charged the battery in almost 2 _MONTHS_ before that and I use my drill more days than not.I've had this drill for almost 6 months and only charged the battery 4 times. It's been dropped onto concrete (once from a lift; several times from a ladder; MANY times from waist-level), kicked across rough flooring, slammed into walls, used as a hammer, and probably other abuses that I _didn't_ see, and it isn't even marked.I only have 3 complaints, none of which are significant at this price level and one of which is both good and bad. 1) This drill comes with no, and has no provisions for, any kind of belt hook. 2) It only comes with one battery (not so important, given how long it lasts!). 3) When the battery dies, it doesn't run down at all. It just STOPS. You get full power until you have none left.The DS10DFL is very light, with most of the well-balanced weight in the motor. The battery has a flat bottom so you can stand it upright, but there's very little weight down there and the battery is physically small, so it's not very stable. The green portions are a rubberized material that makes it much more pleasant to lean into and the back of the motor housing is flat with no vents, providing a good surface for your other hand to press on. The rear screw just above the battery well has a tiny gap around it with just enough space to loop a tether if you're so inclined. The forward-lock-reverse pin engages firmly but doesn't take excessive force to move. The trigger is \"infinitely\" variable, down to < 1 RPM in both high and low gears.I've had the opportunity to use Bosch, Makita, DeWalt, Ridgid, Milwaukee, Black & Decker, and Porter Cable drills, among others, in 12V MAX (10.8V LiIon), 18V NiCad and LiIon, and 20V MAX (18V LiIon), and this is by far my favorite.",

The added benefit of a flashlight which turns on whenever you press the drill button works great in those hard to see areas.

        "reviewText": "I bought this to replace an aging 14 V NiCd Makita which was extremely heavy, and which made working overhead tiring. I figured I'd be losing battery life and torque moving to a smaller tool like this, but that it was a reasonable sacrifice and wouldn't matter for working in wood. I was wrong, but in a good way: this tool is no sacrifice at all. The power is phenomenal, and one thing you should consider is that if you're working overhead, a lighter tool actually will perform better than a heavy one, all things considered (i.e. same power). The reason is that without you fighting the weight, you can put more of your own strength into the drilling or driving, meaning you can more effectively use the power in the tool. For example, I found that moving to this tool meant that I had less problems with cam-out when driving wood screws for window treatments; I was able to put more force into the screw because I didn't have to fight the weight of the tool as much.The tool has an extremely solid feel to it, from the heavy trigger to the tightness of the clutch adjustment. Everything about the tool feels well-made and tight. Much different from other tools I've owned.The battery, despite it weighing virtually nothing (relative to the drill itself) has surprising capacity. In fact, despite using it for a couple of project already, I still haven't had the battery indicator drop below \"full\" indication. Couple that with a 30 minute charge, and you can really do with just owning one or two batteries. While Lithium ion batteries don't have the same kind of shelf life as NiCd batteries do, the fact that they are so light and charge so quickly makes up for this. I get much more life out of these per charge than the 14 V NiCd I was using before, and yet they are \u2153 the size and what seems like 1/10 the weight.The LED light is nice, but really only helps when starting a hole; once you start drilling the chuck quickly obscures the light.All in all, this is a really well-built tool with few flaws. In fact, the worst thing I can think to say about this drill is that the trigger lock is poorly designed, and doesn't stay in position very well. But that's it--that's pretty much the only bad thing I can think to say about this fantastic drill. I'm a very picky and critical engineer, so if I'm this happy with a tool I'm confident that most people will not be disappointed with it.",

I was looking for a replacement battery when I saw that this \"on sale\" drill kit was only $10 more than a battery.  Kit also included a stud finder which works great.  Dropped it to 4 stars because you have to plug the drill with the battery installed into a 110 volt outlet to recharge the battery.  This means you can't use the tool with a 2nd battery while the dead battery is recharging.  My other 4 tools came with a separate charger.",

Selecting the type of kit I wanted was a little exasperating due to the fact that tools of varying voltages were represented, and in the case of Hitachi, they look alike in the pictures.The drill kit has all the items necessary to almost immediately initiate a home project using a drill to fasten items that do not require a heavy-duty drill.  The quick charge batteries included make recharging easy.The chuck on the drill can loosen during use against the bit (or driver) if the bit is not perfectly straight in the chuck.So far, my use of the light was limited to determine whether it worked, which it does.I am completely satisfied with the purchase... especially for the price.",

The pros are that it is lightweight and easy to handle, has a nice grip, and the batteries charge fairly quick...and since there are two batteries, you can charge one while using the other, and by the time the one you are using runs out, the other should be done recharging, which is a nice feature for bigger jobs.  The downside is the power is just so-so, and I find myself having to pull out my electric drill from time to time to do some of the heavier duty work, but it is only a 12V so it really only has so much power to offer.  The flashlight is actually quite nice, I like the adjustable head on it, it will go a long time on a single charge, and it has come in handy for many uses.  Overall, I would say the product is very good, and is comparable to some of the higher-end power tools out there, but not quite to the level of the top-end tools.",

The most annoying thing is the chuck which is impossible to get tight and the drill bits gets stuck in what you are drilling and come right out.  I never use the flashlight which is pretty useless with poor charge life on batteries.  I ended up giving mine away and got a heavy duty Milwaukee I got so frustrated with it.

They've held up beautifully, but the batteries have now begun to fail.  Not surprising, it's cheaper to buy the complete drill set with two batteries for the price of replacement batteries alone.  So, I now own three drills.  They all still work as well as ever.  These weren't meant to drive three-inch deck screws, but for light around the house use, they're hard to beat.  I'll probably buy another before Hitachi terminates production.",

The Forward/Reverse switch is easily used with one finger on each side and it has variable speed in both of the #1 or #2 speed/torque selector switch on top.  0-350 and 0-1300 RPM. It also has instant stop. It will stop spinning from a high speed to a dead stop in a split second.I have the lithium battery quick charger from Ryobi which only takes about 25 min. to charge a practically dead battery which really makes this drill very handy especially if you have 2 batteries . The battery it uses, the P103, fits most all other Ryobi products also.The drill I got holds a bit much smaller than a 1/16 inch easily.Would have given it 5 stars except for it having a barely noticeable wobble in its spin, but can't be beat for the price and its features.",

Didn't need a dedicated impact driver, so wanted a driver/drill device.  This still has lots and lots of torque, but probably won't loosen stubborn lug nuts like a dedicated impact driver.Quick-release hex bit holder.  For those not familiar with how these work, and the limitations using standard (smooth-shanked) bits, stop by your local Home Depot and see how great they are for 99% of home owners/projects.  I say this because of earlier reviews that seemed confused or unaware of the difference.  Hex bits can be bought in sets or individually everywhere tools are sold.",

This was an URGENT purchase for a project and I am REALLY ANNOYED. You have to buy a seperate chuck (approx $30) to use it with traditional drill bits. Again not mentioned, or even suggested as a co-purchase.FAIL AMAZON, FAIL! I'm really annoyed. The next time I purchase a $100 piece of equipment expecting to use it in 2 days, I will go to Home Depot or Lowes, locally.Note that someone also mentioned this problem, but left it as a 3 STAR review, meaning that I didn't really see it - I only click on 1 or 2 stars typically to see the bad feedback. This is a very annoyed piece of feedback, and I'm making it 1-star so that everyone who considers purchasing it, knows that it won't accept their \"legacy\" drill bits.",

The two speeds and multiple torque break settings are great for racking dozens of servers(high speed-high torque), and for hard drive replacements(low speed-low torque). The 12-volt batteries are lithium, and VERY lightweight. I don't get any fatigue from holding this drill overhead, like my co-worker that has an 18v. The LED light that points to your work is also great. The batteries last a long time, and since there are two of them, there is very little downtime for battery swaps.",

This is the best 12V compact I have come across, although Milwaukee is close (this wins out over Milwaukee on looks only).The hex bit holder is very easy to use.  Just lift it up, put the bit in, and release.  You can jiggle it around all day and it will never come out.  The little light is nice to have, especially when I forget my flashlight.  It's pretty bright for a power driver like this.  It comes with 1 extra battery and a charger in a nice plastic case.The only conceivable con is that it is actually made in China, not Japan.  It has not effected the quality, as Makita has very high quality control.  I still wish it was made in Japan, though.",

After the Hitachi broke after 1 month I decided I needed something smaller but just as much power if not more. I purchased the Makita over the weekend, and for the last 3 days of use this little impact drill has amazed me every bit. It's comfortable, light, fit in my tool bag without worry of dropping. I have to switch batteries after about an hour or two, but thats only after 500 self tapping screws in tin studs. Great drill, I wish I would of bought this first.

I had never used an impact driver before I bought this but they are the future!  No more burred screw heads!!Anyway, back to this guy, I have had numerous cordless drills, and this is the best I have had.  It has heaps of torque, issmall so can fit in your belt or pocket, and best of all its light!  The light is pretty handy too.  The quick realse is fantastic, you just need to buy quick release drill bits or a quik release drill head.One of the sweetest drills I have had a Swiss made Bosch, and the 2 batteries only lasted 10 months!  This Makita is still going strong after 2 years of abuse!",

        "reviewText": "I typically like the small Bosch tools, but an annual Tool Guide that I highly respect chose this as the best 12-volt lithium-ion powered drill for the money. And I like the heft and feel of it a lot. But research the additional purchase options before you buy! You may miss out on a real bargain. The included belt hook is icing on the cake.The drill alone is listed as the DCD710. It comes with a charger and one battery.You can also buy only the drill. Not sure if there is a separate part number but the description will read \"Bare Tool\", meaning \"No Battery. No Charger.\"But then you can buy the DCD710S2 -- the one I'm reviewing. The S2 simply means it has two batteries, along with the charger.The reason I'm reviewing THIS unit is because I did order it before noticing the next option...And then there's the one I actually bought -- the DCK211S2:http://www.amazon.com/DEWALT-DCK211S2-12-Volt-Driver-Impact/dp/B0044DEXPW/ref=sr_1_2?s=hi&ie=UTF8&qid=1370206491&sr=1-2&keywords=dck210s2This includes the DCD710, plus 2 batteries, plus the charger, PLUS their 12-volt DCF815 Impact Driver.I chose that one because I find real bargains in shopping the Marketplace / Amazon Warehouse Deals options. In my case, it was Amazon's Warehouse Deals -- which gave me the Impact Driver for a small $20 difference! $20 for a 12-volt Impact Driver? You can't pass that up! These sell for $63 on their own.And there are multiple other optional packages. So be sure you look into where the bargain lies.NOTE 1: Be careful. One version is for a very similar-looking Powered Screwdriver -- not the Drill.The confusing part, to me, is the part number is DCK210S2 -- very close to the DCD710, but it does NOT include the DCD710.They aren't the same tools. Read the descriptions carefully. I bought the drill in order to drill holes. A screwdriver doesn't typically have the same kind of power, but will drive screws okay.NOTE 2: I had to call DeWalt to get this Part Number discrepancy explained to me, but even their Rep was a little confused in trying to explain the kit differences -- or why the drills in the Kits have the same exact Part Number, but the photos look a little different from the stand-alone offers. For example, the kit I bought is DCK211, but the Drill and Impactt Driver have numbers DCD710 and DCF815 -- but are not described as such in that Kit description.NOTE 3: The Kit comes with a Phillips Bit that is not the type that \"locks\" into the pull-type tip holder on the Hammer Drill. Why they include it is anybody's guess. Makes no sense to me. It should have the detent in the bit so the bit can lock in place.",

        "reviewText": "Well, my fathers' birthday was coming up this year and I asked him what he wanted. He simply said he needed a new drill. I immediately set out to find something that was in my budget, but gave him a solid piece of equipment. I have used all manners of Dewalts at my job, from small drivers, to the bad boy XPRs, so I knew I wanted to go with Dewalt. After checking every retailer, amazon had it for 50% less than any other place I could find. So, I ordered it and delivered it to my dad. We have since used it to beef up our deck, hang drywall, and built a workbench. This drill will laugh at whatever you throw in front of it. The torque is great for something that is \"compact\", and I had to warn my dad that Dewalts will snap the heads off of bolts and screws if you aren't careful. I know some other reviews balked about the drill having cosmetic damages upon arrival, but this one was absolutely gorgeous. It isn't nearly as heavy as the XPR series, and it beats the heck outta any Craftsman I've ever used. I would highly recommend this drill, and judging by the fact that my dad now comes up with any excuse to use it, I'd say he would recommend it too.",

        "reviewText": "BOSTITCH Impact Driver BTC440 and Drill/Driver BTC400 each comes in a sturdy plastic box, with a recharging unit that plugs into a conventional home 2-prong socket. Both products come with their own snap-on battery unit that clips at the bottom of the handle. Each device is a wonder to behold, in terms of design. The devices are light enough for a 12-year old to operate.  The Star Wars design of these devices is enhanced by the fact that each device has a built-in flashlight that is activated by the trigger, and that illuminates the workpiece.  The Star Wars aspect of both BOSTITCH devices is further enhanced by the unusual sound coming from the motor--because the motor has a brake that automatically halts rotation of the motor, when you release the trigger.  In other words, this is NOT your grandfather's electric drill, which always had a gradual slowing of the motor, and gradual diminuation of the sound, whenever the trigger was released.  The instruction manual does not state the purpose of the brake.  However, it might be assumed that the brake reduces wear and tear on drill bits, caused by torque, in the situation where the trigger is released when the drill bit is still embedded in a wooden workpiece.The BOSTITCH BTC400 drill/driver and the BOSTITCH BTC440 driver each come with their own instruction booklet. Both instruction books refer to an extension cord. Both instruction books refer to an extension cord. The device itself CANNOT operate with any extension cord. (The device operates only with a battery that is mounted at the bottom of the handle.)  The booklet's reference to the extension cord means the extension cord of the battery recharging unit.DRILL/DRIVER BTC400. The instruction book is 12 pages long, in English, with duplicated instructions in French and in Spanish. The instructions have pictures showing these parts: TRIGGER SWITCH; FORWARD/REVERSE BUTTON; TORQUE ADJUST COLLAR; DUAL RANGE GEAR SELECTOR; keyless chuck, bit holder, battery; battery release button; and built-in flashlight. The instructions state that the device can be used as a screw driver, and for drilling. The instructions provide guidance for drilling in wood, metal (use lubricants), and masonry (use carbide tips). The instructions tell you how to pull the trigger, which can make the drill rotate at various speeds, and how to reverse the drill's rotation. Unlike the situation with the BTC440 IMPACT DRIVER, which recommends not using variable speeds, the instructions for the DRILL/DRIVER BTC400 do not recommend against using variable speeds. The illustrations on page 9 make it very clear that the BTC400 is a very unique device. There is a TORQUE ADJUSTMENT that has 22 settings, plus an additional setting for drilling (with a little picture of a drill bit). There is also a GEAR SHIFT, with two settings, and which is located on top of the device. The CHUCK works by hand, and you can spin the chuck around to make the three prongs open and close. When fully closed (and extending from the distal end of the CHUCK), the prongs form a tube that is about one millimeter in diameter, and when fully opened (and retracted into the CHUCK), it is evident that the CHUCK can hold drill bits of up to a half inch in diameter.IMPACT DRIVER BTC440. The booklet has 11 pages of instructions in English, and their are also instructions in French and in Spanish. About half of the instructions are devoted to safety and, in particular, to safety in using the recharging unit. The instructions show the parts of the BTC440: TRIGGER SWITCH; FORWARD/REVERSE BUTTON; CHUCK COLLAR; QUICK-RELEASE CHUCK; flashlight, bit holder, battery, and battery-release button. The charger automatically tells you if the battery is bad, by way of blinking. The charger also tells you if the batter is too hot or too cold to recharge. The BTC440 has a brake that halts the chuck's rotation when you release the trigger switch. The chuck can only hold accessories that have a quarter-inch hexagonal cross-section. Page 9 shows how to insert and secure an \"accessory,\" such as a screw driver tip. The instructions fail to describe what the BTC440 can be used for. Is it just for use with screwdriver tips? What about a wire brush? Or a carborundum sanding tip? Or how about a router tip? My guess, is that any shank that is hexagonal and has a quarter inch diameter can be used. the BTC440 IMPACT DRIVER, seems to recommend not using variable speeds, and to only use maximal speed (but on this point, the instruction book is not clearly written).CONCLUSION. Both of the BOSTITCH devices are elegant in appearance and are comfortable to hold, and are heavy enough to inspire confidence, and light enough for any teenager to use. The user will need to purchase drill bits and screw driver tips. A strong point of this product is the detachable unit that holds the rechargeable batteries. Hence, a main selling point is that the user will NOT have to worry about electric shocks when using the unit outside or on a concrete surface. The kit comes with a recharging unit, and it is the case that the battery units and the recharging unit are dedicated to each other, and cannot be interchanged with products made by other manufacturers. Although folks with a Puritan work ethic might prefer to use manually operated drills and manually operated screwdrivers, please note that the BOSTITCH device provides the following advantages. If are doing repetitive work, such as building a house, it makes no sense to use a manual screw driver. If you want to avoid callouses on your hands, then it makes more sense to use the BOSTITCH device. If you need to work in a confined space that does not permit using the manual counterparts, it makes more sense to use the BOSTITCH device. If you want to be inspired, not only by the objects that you are making, but also by implements with a Star Wars-style design, then it makes more sense to use the BOSTITCH device.",

        "reviewText": "This is the go-to cordless screwdriver in our prototype shop. The size, weight, and weight distribution (down and slightly forward) are good for situations where you will be using it continuously. The battery indicator lights are useful as is the self illumination. While it does vent out the back it is not quite as extreme as some which, combined with the soft touch butt-end material, make for pressure drilling with your hand on the back possible. I can't emphasize that enough since some high-end screwdriver/drills vent very hot air right where you might need to place your hand on the back end.Negatives: While the ergonomics are generally good, I have found that my thumb joint rubs right where the motor meets the handle and raised a blister. Changing my grip alleviated that but then I wasn't as natural. Same issue with the middle finger right below the trigger - use this enough and it will start to rub raw. Again, these aren't huge issues except for people who might use this all day - at which point I would recommend gloves. Mechanically, I have noticed that the chuck seems to loosen quite often when used as a screwdriver with torque settings - my guess is the vibration causes this.",

        "reviewText": "I use this drill in my work.  I install blinds and shutters.  This is my third one.  I buy a new one each time because it is nearly as cheap as buying two new batteries.  The drills have never failed and the batteries typically last me two or more years and I use them up to five hours a day five days a week.My work is rather light duty so the 9.6V drill is perfect.  However, I can get all the torque I need using the slower speed and decent power on the high speed.I can install blinds in 30 plus windows on a single charge (that's 120 to 180 1 1/2\" self-tapping screws).  The drill is so light and comfortable in the hand (well balanced) that fatigue is never an issue (a big deal because I'm on the skinny side).  Charging is very fast so when I'm on a large job I can charge a battery long before I use up the other one.I will keep using them as long as they keep making them and my living depends on my drill.UPDATE 12-5-14I have moved on to a different drill.  I still stand by the positive comments I made about this Dewalt.  However, because of wrist pain after 25 years of using a drill all day I went looking for a more ergonomic design that would reduce the stress on my wrist.  I found it in the Festool CSL Li (read my review there).  The difference is amazing.Let's be clear.  I have not moved away from this Dewalt due to quality.  I just found a drill with a unique design that greatly reduces the stress on my wrist.",

        "reviewText": "This unit is for lightweight works only, due to battery limitation, and for such lightweight works, you can find more lightweight tool, with lighter price, too.BIG CONS:ALMOST USELESS DUE TO WEAK BATTERY (More on this later)Can't stand on battery (bad weight balance).Cons:1st speed is really too slow, currently speeds are 0-300/0-1100rpm. It'll be much handier, if 1st speed was something like 0-600.Bulky charger.Pros:Nice chuck, really can be used with one hand.Great overall build quality.Quite silent (compared to same price range BOSCH tools)1st speed has great torque, outperformed my 18V Bosch PSR18 in that.Regarding unit itself, does not think about it as work unit, this is more like a gift to some nerd, who wants to be \"real\" man, by having real DeWalt tool. While itself unit is reasonably powered, very rigid construction, nice grip and other features included, it's batteries are very weak, making it almost useless for any task. Here's example: I had to hang a big shelf in garage. Walls are made from soft masonry. So I need to drill 4 holes 10mm dia and 120mm depth in masonry for anchors, and also need to drill 4 of 8mm holes into 2mm thick steel stripe. The battery was fully charged, and left in charger for overnight, to be sure that it's fully charged. So, I started drilling. The holes in masonry went like breese, about 10 seconds per hole. Then I went to metal, 1st hole came out quickly, on 2nd, drill started to show signs of slowdown, and on 3rd hole, I only managed to drill 10% or so.So, fully charged battery output was:4 holes with dia 10mm in masonry, 120mm depth each.3 holes with dia 8mm in 2mm thick steel stripe.THAT'S ALL!So consider that information when thinking about purchase.I just can't understand, what is the idea to release such a powerfull drill, with such weak batteries? For light screwdriving? but for such tasks, I'd go out and buy same priced, but much more lightweight and screwdriving aimed li-ion tool! Also, this unit has very fringe balance when standing on battery, tends to fall to front every time, broke several drill bits already!Later I'll try to purchase these alternative, high capacity batteries available on market and update review, if any interesting output.",

Seems every time I want to use my cordless drill, the battery was dead and I'd be waiting two or more hours to charge the battery so I could do what I needed to do. I bought a corded drill because I can always find an electrical outlet. However, I missed my previous drill too much with its easy tighten chuck and ratcheting clutch. I simply couldn't find a corded drill that even came close to matching the features of most cordless drills (seriously, why???) So, considering how little I actually use  drill nowadays I opted for this item on sale and it has turned out to be a great purchase, the chuck is even nicer than my older dead drill (it lived its life well for over 13 years and two remodels)and the clutch easy to set. Its proven to be every bit as powerful as my much older 12volt DeWalt but slightly smaller and lighter. Overall, a great purchase at an amazing price.",

The week after I bought this new and improved 9.6 (more compact than years back) the 14.4 went on sale at Lowes for $89.99 (reg. $149.99).  Wish I would have waited.  I paid $79.99 + shipping, $87.00 total.  The 14.4 is a little better quality for gear adjustments and is a little smaller than the 9.6 on the length of the drill body.  For home use, these drills last and last.  Don't waste your money on the new lithium batteries, because according to a contractor I talked to, the lithium batteries don't last much longer per charge anyway.  He always went back to DeWalt, and so will I.  Jim Mc, Fargo, ND",

I especially liked the LED light that focuses on where you are drilling.  There are different sized batteries that will fit this drill set.  It came with the smallest battery. You can buy a larger battery if you are worried about running out of juice prematurely.  I had a little trouble getting the charger to work. You really have to push the battery into the charger hard for it to connect.  At first I thought there was a defect in the charger. The other thing I didn't like was that it did not come with any screw or drills bits.  That was OK because I have plenty of extra ones, but a beginner might like to have a minimum set.  Also, there was hardly any room to store bits in the plastic case that the drill/driver came in.  My old DeWalt drill/driver case had lots of room for storage of parts and bits.",

I'm a home owner just doing minor work about the homestead. Seems that this drill should have lasted a tad longer and not died on such an undemanding job as that.From the first, I was very disappointed in the battery life. They would never hold a charge for any length of time. I couldn't just grab and go with the drill. I would have to plan my work in advance. Such a pain. At least the recharge time was quick.I did like the grip and the weight of the tool. It was excellent for my small hands.I still have my Ryobi. I'm going to haul it out of it's dusty tool case and see if I can still breathe life into the old girl. In hindsight, I should have just dished out the cash for new batteries on my 10 year-old workhorse. I would have been happier.",

        "reviewText": "We have a regular drill, but when I saw this on the \"Deal of the Day\" and knew that I was going to be installing a curtain rod, I thought the cordless drill would be a good option. It's lightweight enough that I feel comfortable using it as a woman, and heavy duty enough that my husband doesn't think it should be painted pink (though we both find the green flame look pretty cool). The flashlight included is awesome - it cranks to several positions and uses the same batters as the drill, so I don't have to worry about keeping disposable batteries around for it.The negatives:I wish they would charge a bit more and just include a decent set of bitsInstructions for those of us who don't normally deal with drills would have been niceAnd perhaps the most embarrassing negative - it was such a pain to figure out how to put everything back in the case!! Would it be so hard to just put some stickers in there or labels that would tell me how to put the jenga puzzle back together?Overall I am quite pleased with my purchase. Having a cordless drill around is a great thing and the flashlight is used at least a few times a week. I can't comment on how good it is for professionals, but for the weekend warrior or weekend warriorette, it's perfect.",

The batteries were almost fully discharged before recharging all along, so memory should not be a problem. My Makita LI-ION drill , almost the same age, is much more powerful and the charges hold for weeks. From an environmental standpoint the NICAD technology should probably be retired and it's cheaper to buy a whole new drill set than try to replace the batteries.",

The other thing I really love is not having to have a chuck key!  It's so easy to change a bit!  I have put the drill through some challenging trials and it never seemed to struggle at all.  I have drilled and screwed 200 to 300 holes so far, and the battery is still on it's first charge and that actually surprises me since the battery is small.  So far, I have no complaints.

I did experience the wobble initially, but I either don't notice it at this point or it's gone away.Overall, this drill is amazing.  It's stood up to every task an average DIYer could throw at it.  The batteries last for a really long time (don't have exact numbers) even when stored for extended periods of time, and they charge quickly.  The torque and power have been adequate for my needs and I've never found myself reaching for something else that was more powerful to get the job done.I have large hands but I did not find this drill to be small in any way - I'm able to comfortably hold it and it's well balanced.  It's nice that it's small because the drill fits well inside my toolbag for those quick trips to family members houses to fix things.The belt clip doesn't seem too useful to me because the drill swings around and weighs my pants down....the clip is removable though.The LED can be hit or miss.  It's not positioned in the best of places (since the chuck usually blocks it) but it's come in handy a few times.",

And being a prime member the next day shipping was great so I decided to take a chance.But sure as was stated in the reviews, the wobble, which was present right out of the box,  has gotten worse.Really worse.  Forget about doing any precise drilling/driving. It is getting worse every time I use it. I almost returned it but I really needed the tool for work and I really could not have that amount of money in limbo, especially at that time of the year. So it is still in use. Not my gotoTo be fair, the 20v LiOn is fantastic. The small battery pack lasts a long time for me and recharges quick. But when it dies it dies. No warning.but I will not go back to an 18V model if I can help it.That being said, I can't wait until this drill \"gives up the ghost\" as they say so I can justify to purchase another one.

        "reviewText": "Initially I really liked this drill at the store. It felt balanced, light, handle felt nice and ergonomic and I liked the idea of having more power for DIY projects. The sale price was really good too at $149. But when I got home and used it, it was a completely different story. Here are the good and the bad:The Good:1. Pretty good power2. Grip is thinner and ergonomic3. Looks and feels well built and compact4. Tightening the chuck to a bit felt very firm and secure5. Hard Dewalt case well built and looks professional6. Has belt clip and magnetic bit holder at base of drillThe Bad:1. Chuck wobble-wasn't as bad as other reviews and on Youtube but was bad enough that it was unacceptable2. Plastic chuck scratches easily- felt cheap (the Dewalt 985 hammer drill has a metal chuck)3. Led light is bright but totally useless. It doesn't project on the hole since its blocked by the longer chuck4. Battery design felt nice at first but gets in the way in tight spaces5. Didn't feel that much easier or faster than my friend's Milwaukee M12 hammer drill in drywall or wood. Didn't try in concrete.6. No battery charge indicator. Wow, didn't realize how important this is until I realized it was missing on this drill.7. Inside: Plastic gearbox, non-jampot design felt cheap and not as well designed for high torque. Even the 12V Milwaukee M12 hammer drill (2411-22) has all metal gears, gearbox, clutch, and chuck in a jampot design.Although I liked this drill at first, I returned it soon afterward to HD and got the Milwaukee M12 hammer drill. The Milwaukee was better on many fronts including its 5 year tool warranty. I was very impressed with the all metal gearbox and chuck in a jampot design, accurate battery indicator, no chuck wobble, LED light that works better since shorter chuck, torpedo battery design better for tight spaces, and the overall lightness and compactness. Also although the Milwaukee at 12V is supposed to have less power and torque (275 vs 350) than the 20V Dewalt, I was surprised to find the difference very neglible for smaller home projects. Actually for small projects, I liked the Milwaukee much better since it was significantly lighter, drilled cleaner holes, just as fast, with less mess using the same exact bit. The Dewalt just sounds a lot louder and higher giving the impression of being more powerful but didnt make my holes any faster. To be fair, maybe the Dewalt power difference would be more noticeable in concrete or bigger projects assuming its battery lasts long but I didn't notice much difference in wood and drywall home projects. The Dewalt does come with a metal belt clip but my friend got a nice holster for his Milwaukee M12 that protects it, holds bits, and looks nice.",

It's a great product, takes regular alkaline batteries which last forever, and includes your expected screw driver bits and a couple of drill bits which are specialized to fit within the fixed size chunk. The speed is slow, so it's not really meant to drill, but it works in a pinch, and the speed makes it quite safe for younger kids who are developing skills and confidence with tools. The only improvement to this item would be if there was some way to store the tips within the product itself, and if the chuck was able to accept round bits.",

I had some intermittent chuck problems (not grabbing) about year after I got it until I finally burned up the motor a few months ago. I was kind of bummed because I was really looking forward to buying the new dewalt 12v drill, but I absolutely need a hammer drill so had to replace it first.  I have numerous other 18v dewalt tools and lots of batteries so it really didn't make any sense for me to do anything but get another dewalt.  I found this bare tool only for a good price and went for it.Holy cow. I don't know what happened to drill technology during the past 6 years but what a difference. My old drill was a 900 series model and at least $75 more but this thing completely smokes it!  To analogize, my old drill was a cargo van and this one is a BMW SUV. It just plain feels better to use.What I like:ResponsivePowerfulLED lightcompact, i.e. lighterWhat I don't like:Nothing yetI just hope the quality control is better. So far so good. To tell you the truth I kind of don't even care about the smaller drill at this point. I do have a smaller 14v impact driver but this drill may be light enough to be a primary drill.  (i have always wanted 1 smaller 9v or 12 v drill  AND a 18v hammer drill) Anyway, my sentiments at this point are that this drill kick's A**.Highly recommended.",

        "reviewText": "I've had a DeWALT 12V XRP for about 15 years. It is good in all respects, except for battery life and duration. I've bought seven batteries and two chargers over the past 15 years. With sporadic use, that comes to about 2 1/2 years per battery. For continuous use, as driving #6 screws into plywood the battery would last about 20 to 25 minutes and it takes about an hour to re-charge. So I started looking for a new cordless drill.I bought the DC730. The designation on the cardboard box and on the case show the model as DC730KA, while on the drill it shows DC730. I checked on the DeWALT site, they do not show the DC730. I am not sure if that is an oversight by the marketing savants at DeWALT, or this is a different model. Judging by the glowing reviews for the DC730KA, I must conclude that I either have a lemon, or a different model.The positive features are the ergonomics, it fits the hand very well: it is compact-slightly smaller and lighter than my old 12V; and I like very much the LED light that comes on when you press the trigger.I expected the 14.4V battery to last longer and to have more power than the 12V. It does neither. The 14.4V lasts less than half than my old 12V, or about 10 minutes, while it takes an hour to re-charge. I did the 8 hour charge per the manual, to \"equalize the cells\", and did not discern any difference. When searching on the DeWALT site for the DC730, it displayed the DC730KA. The battery DW9094 is shown as discontinued. The charger DW9118 is also shown as discontinued.The motor is much noisier than on my 12V. The case is OK, but it is larger than that of 12V and the layout is not as good. I guess DeWALT must have let go of their case designers. The most compelling reason to return the drill was the chuck. It does not hold drills 1/8\" dia. or less. They slip no matter how much you \"ratchet\" the chuck. This is not the DeWALT I used to know.",

It replaced a 12 volt model I have used for 10 years that finally gave up the ghost - in fact to replace with a 12 volt would have been more costly due to the sale so I went with this one.I have been very pleased with the performance of this unit and especially the fast charging and additional power compared to the 12 volt. My first project was a 15 foot red cedar garden bridge I built to cross a small stream - this involved drilling about 20 half-inch holes and screwing in about 400 deck screws. For virtually the entire project I was constantly using this drill and by the time I went through one battery pack the other one was charged and ready to go (so about an hour or more of constant use, which is impressive).I am looking forward to using the more compact design in tight spots as that had been an issue with my prior drill and the LED light looks useful as well.UPDATE 12-18-10:Several months (and several projects) later and this drill is still going strong. The LED light is really not too useful, however, as the chuck creates a shadow right where you are drilling. Easily fixed with a piece of electrical tape to cover it up, if you want to bother (I haven't). I think this feature would be of use if they put the light down just above the battery on the front, shining upward into the area where the drill bit is. But then again, I'm not a tool designer and there is likely some reason that would not work. Anyway, still a great product which I would buy again.",

Is a bit shorter than my old 12v but is a bit heavier too. But ok.Worth 135$.  Too bad the Panasonics are so stupidly overpriced.",

As a result of not being an 18V unit, it is substantially less bulky and easier to handle in tighter corners.  Dual batteries is nice in that you can be charging one while the other is in use -- something I had to do very frequently during a recent home renovation.",

My previous drill was a Makita, its carry/storage case had room inside for me to store a 35 piece drill driver set in its own hard case. This allowed me to grab the drill in its case and go, without having to remember to carry the drill driver set separately like I have to now with the DeWalt. The DeWalt case is actually larger than the Makita, but there is too much space wasted on plastic molding. The interior space could easily be reconfigured to accommodate a case for drills/drivers.RichardRutland, MA",

        "reviewText": "The Milwaukee driver drill has, as expected, met most of my expectations. So far, it is a solid and powerful workhorse that is  never left behind when I'm staging tools for almost any project.As an advanced do-it-yourselfer, I require complete reliability and ruggedness for my tools. I believe in the adage that you should buy good tools ONE time. In today's electronic world, that is not possible but there is absolutely no reason that even electric or battery operated equipment shouldn't give long and reliable service.I purchased the Milwaukee driver/drill as a replacement for my previous Milwaukee cordless drill which I had had for approximately 7 years. That drill itself replaced a Dewalt which only lasted one year. I chose to go with Milwaukee again, because 7 years for a battery operated drill is outstanding. In fact, the only reason I replaced the previous drill was because buying 2 replacement batteries was nearly 3/4 of the cost of this drill (with battery and case) at my local brick and mortar store. Had I been able to get batteries at a reasonable price, I'd still be using the previous Milwaukee drill!The Milwaukee driver/drill has a lot going for it. First and foremost, I find myself in a little bit of awe with the advances that have been made to the battery technology. This drill is a little bit more powerful than the one it replaced yet the batteries are less than half the size, don't weigh as much, charge faster and include a charge indicator.I use the Milwaukee driver/drill on literally almost every single project that I've undertaken since I got it. It seems to be a bit more powerful and the batteries certainly last longer than they did on its predecessor.The operation of this drill is simple and intuitive. I must admit I didn't even bother reading the instruction manual until later, after I purchased this drill. The key-less chuck system remains a high point of my experience with  Milwaukee products. It's easy to ratchet down the chuck in such a manner as to tightly hold in place large shank, over-sized bits.Changing bits out is quick and easy. Switching between drill bits, and screwdriver bits is a snap, so I rarely bring out two drills at a time, as I used to do.The drive speed is precise and the trigger control allows for a very positive feel while spinning up the chuck to the desired revs.For me, there are two downsides to this drill. On half a dozen occasions, I've found that switching the top switch from one to two, in order to change the speed gearing has been problematic. The tool hasn't always fully engaged the internal gears properly, resulting in a high pitched grinding sound. This can be remedied by stopping the drill and pushing the switch back and forth the second time and/or turning the chuck by hand.The second thing that I really don't like about this drill is that the chuck is painted black rather than being either rubber coated, as my last one was, or being left without a scratch-able finish.My tools are anything but toolbox clean. They get lots of heavy use and I don't spend enormous amounts of time polishing them or worrying about aesthetics. However, I've found the black paint on the chuck to really show scratches the FIRST day. What would have been barely noticeable on either rubber, or unfinished seal, really pops out as the black paint is easily scratched off. This makes it looks like the tool has been abused when in fact, it's only been used in a couple of tight places where the chuck came in contact with another surface during its operation.Despite these two shortcomings, I really love this drill. I'm a little concerned about the aforementioned occasional grinding noise when speed switching but with these caveats in mind, I can still recommend the Milwaukee driver/drill.*Note: I wrote this review with my husband. All of the above opinions/words/sentiments are his.",

The caveat is that lithium ion batteries (no matter which brand), begin to deteriorate from day one...whether they are being used or not.

In the end, the ability to swap heads swayed my decision. It comes with a battery and charger but no case or accessories. I have not had many projects to do but the drill seems to have nice torque and speed. It feels durable in my hand. The head is almost entirely cast metal. I will come back with a better review after I get the chance to really put it to work.",

My only Complaint is the battery life leaves much to be desired. I would recommend anybody purchasing this product order an extra battery and you should never have a problem with the Black & Decker. I rate this Black & Decker as a four just because of the shorter battery life.Other than that I think it's a great product and for the price you can't beat it. My next step is going to buy the attachments but right now I will continue to enjoy my Black & Decker",

Our dad was remodeling the bathroom so he's been using it to drive screws into all sorts of surfaces and thickness of woods and other materials. There hasn't been a use it hasn't accomplished yet.

I went back and forth between Milwaukee Tool and Dewalt and the more I looked and price as well as pros and cons from contractor friends and mechanic friends one of them said why do you need pro-grade tools yes they work great and last a long time but he said why dont I save some money and look at like black and decker they are lower cost and work fantasic for what I need. So for Christmas my father in law got us the 20v matrix (I say us because my wife and I build and do projects together she also enjoys it) I have used the Drill, Router, cutoff saw and Impact so far on a recent build and they all worked great) the battery has a good life to it ( I did buy a 2nd battery right away though may not have needed it after using it but nice to have) I would highly recommend this for any DIY person. surely I would not build a house with this even a big deck might be a bit too much for it that I would borrow something better from a friend. but its a great tool at a great price.",

        "reviewText": "History of why I bought this:  Unlike the other users post I actually do own this tool.  I bought it after my dewalt 14v batteris died in the middle of a project on black Friday.  I had those things for almost 10 years so I was happy at how long I was able to get use out of them but replacement batteries were simply expensive.  I had read the review of this tool in popular mechanics and thought well Dewalt is superior (My opinion) but it's the same company so why not I'll give it a try based on their review.  Also it was a black Friday deal and was at a really good price.Review:  I've used for this now some weekdays and every weekend for the past 3 1/2 weeks now all the attachments (except for the sander) quite a bit.Drill:  The drill works the way it should, mostly because I have good bits so there's not much to say on that.Oscillator:  The oscillator is great!  Because of the speed it cuts efficiently and accurately.  Unlike a past oscillator I had the numbers haven't been worn out after 3 tries yet and I've used this one heavily so I'm happy to still have a working gauge.Trim Saw:  I had some issues with the first trim saw attachment that I owned but based on some other peoples feedback I decided to give it another try and got a new one.  The trim saw attachment is fast at it cuts great.  The arrow is clearly marked and doesn't get covered with saw dust so it's easy to keep the blade on track for straight lines.  Additionally, the saw dust doesn't clump up at the gauge area so I am able to see my marked lines through the whole cut without having to stop and clear dust out of the way.  That was a pet peeve of mine on 2 other circular saws that I've used in the past.JigSaw:  The jig saw (again with good blades) makes clean cuts.  I've used this minimally compared to the other attachments.  To date I have loved this tool because the cuts are clean (Good blades).  It supports both T and U type blades so even if you've never used a Jig saw you won't have to worry about buying the wrong blade.  I haven't had to use any curve cut blades but the reverse blades worked great on this for me.Impact Driver:  I haven't had a need to use it yet.Router Head:  I'm thinking of picking this up.  I have a good jig for making my dove tails but have been borrowing a friend's C&W router after mine died.  I'm still used to using the bigger routers and something so small seems an anathma to me but if I can find a good deal on it I will review it as soon as I get it.Battery:  These newer Lithium Ion batteries are supposed to last longer than the old NickleCad's that were on my old tools so I'm looking forward to the longer life since my last ones lasted almost 10 years, although after about 5 years they were mostly dead.  I would have to keep one on the charger, use my tools for about an hour and then swap the batteries.  Even when the tool was new I'd get about 2 hours at most out of a single battery use.  With this new battery I charge it over night and start my day at 8am and finish around 6 or 7 at night and the battery still has juice in it.  At some point I'll buy a second battery just incase this goes bad but to date I am very happy with the performance of the battery on this thing.",

It was my first time using a drill and it was a great experience! So easy to use, very powerful, and light weight. Worked great with drill bits of another brand. Was able to easily drill through galvanized steel by myself to create marquee lights. I really like how you can change the voltage to best suit your project. Great drill! Wish I had one of my own!",

It may sound like a lot but that's about two holes in my cabinets before having to wait hours to continue. I had the drill hang up once and it has already given me the \"smell of death\" from the motor so I don't have high hopes for the life of the drill. I understand its a cheap cordless drill but I have used many others and to give it 3 stars and saying it is average is false. I have built a deck using dewalt cordless drills half the size that last 6 hours on a charge. This drill isn't worthless but like I said if your looking to do more than the very small around the house jobs this drill isn't for you.",

I use it daily to power a bur grinder that I originally had to run off a corded power drill, my 4.9v drill that I replaced with a 10v pack couldn't do the job.Solidly built, key-less chuck works great and fits my 3/8 bits.Cons: Squeals at anything but full power. This is a design issue where the pulse width modulator works in the audible range, giving a high pitch noise when operated under low speed.Battery pack is Ni-Cad instead of newer Lithium Ion, so while it works great for daily use, it's batteries are only rated at 1/3 the run time of more expensive but comparable voltage packs/drills.Other: The 95% plastic construction, toy-like looks is something not conveyed in the pictures. Not to say it isn't solidly built, but as far as appearances and feel go it is clear that this is a lower end drill.",

        "reviewText": "I was very surprised by this drill. Because of the low price I thought it would be just a common utility tool.Instead it turned out to be a good all around drill. I really like the auto-sense ability for setting screws flush with the surface.I tried it with several screw types (wood, pan head, self tapping, etc.) on both soft (pine) and hard woods (walnut). And it worked well in all cases. For most attempts it drove the screw flush and stopped. In two cases in which it didn't screw flush when it stopped, keeping the trigger depressed walked the screw to a flush fit with simple twists.I also liked the top display that shows the battery status. I have DeWalt, Makita, Rigid, and Ryobi 20 volt drills and their battery status displays are on the battery. This requires that you stop and twist the drill upwards. Then you need to press a button on the battery to show the charge status. The B&D drill has a unique lite charge display on the top right behind the selection buttons that control the choice of drill function or screw functions (this is the one that invokes the flush surface sensor). I often found that with my other drills I would be busy using the drill and didn't stop often enough and check the battery status. This often meant that the \"''low\" charge warning would come through the drill slowing down. This isn't good for the battery (even LI-ion) to run it to almost fully discharged. The B&D's display is always visible, so swapping it out before it goes too low is much easier.",

        "reviewText": "This review is for all the tool snobs out there. I LOVE this drill.  I started building & DIYing over a year ago & up until the purchase of this drill, I was using an ancient DeWalt & a Kraft tech, both corded. Recently, I became pretty fed up with the cords getting in the way & decided it was time to go cordless. As crazy as it may sound, the main factor in my choice of purchase for a cordless drill was weight. I have carpal tunnel & a cyst in my left wrist. Also, I'm a chick. No upper body strength, whatsoever. To avoid wrist fatigue while working, I knew I needed a drill with a battery on the lighter side. My tool snob dad suggested either Makita, Dewalt, or Hitachi. After actually holding the latter two in my hands, I concluded they were both much heavier than what I wanted. And the Stanley Bostitch, though at a great price for the holidays, was also a bit heavier than I would like. This drill, however, was the lightest of any I had tested. Now, even though I'm a novice builder, my dad was a carpenter for almost 30 years & has spit on the Black & Decker name for all the 25 years I've known him. He, like many other experienced woodworkers, prefer just about any other power tool than one with the B&D logo. Despite this, I decided to take a chance and so far, I'm glad I did.-I've always hated the idea of a corded drill because I hate the idea of it going dead halfway through a project. But so far so good. The battery life is good from what I can see. And the indicator on top of the drill is awesome. It makes you wonder why they're not putting it on most other drills. ANYTHING with a battery should have a battery indicator, but this is just my opinion. The battery is super easy to remove & replace for charging.-The level of power is perfect for my needs. I wont be framing out a house or driving sheet metal screws into tin roofing. Or driving thick bolts into who knows what. I build things. Furniture mostly. And for the most part, I work with softwoods (pine & cedar). So far, this drill holds up nicely for that purpose. You can also choose between driving a screw or drilling a pilot hole. This is nifty. Not to mention, the little light that illuminates the area where you're drilling is a Godsend. Very handy. Something that once again, ALL drills should have. I get a perfect grip on the handle, as it's not too thick (my fingers are short) & it's comfortable because of the soft rubbery coating. Also, no issues with autosense, as some others have reported. Truth be told, I prefer to drive my screws slowly. To prevent slipping & other stripping. Overall, usability is A+++.Bottom line, I've always believed you can buy a lemon in anything. And as little known as it is, many name brands release the same product at different levels of quality, which will reflect in said item's price. Case in point, the auto industry. There's a world of difference in the Chevrolet Camaro & the Chevrolet Cobalt, right? There's also the fact that a fully loaded vehicle will cost you much more than a car with manual windows & locks. Yes, I know I'm talking about a completely different product, but my point carries just the same. People are most like upset because they have bought the more cheaply made B&D in the past have been let down by their quality. Problem is, the old cliche is 100% true. You get what you pay for every time. I could have gone with the $30 B&D drill. But I spent more. Because I wanted more. To anyone surfing the web & debating which drill to buy, give this one a chance. I'm sure you'll like it.",

Let's face it a driver is a driver, most of them have a good grip and this one does, most of them look good and this one does, and most of them have a nice place to carry your bit and this one does, but what this one has that most of the others do not have is a lighter and shorter body. It is about 5-6oz. lighter and a full one inch or more shorter than my De Walt...  I really could have used the lesser drill head on my last project.I like this drill I a, sure I will be using it often it also comes with a nice carrying case with a zipper and a nice handle to carry it.....

        "reviewText": "Earlier this year, I bought a very similar lighter weight 20 volt Black and Decker lithium battery drill with a molded plastic case with drill accessories. I paid about $63 for the drill, molded plastic case and drill accessory kit. At the time I used it to install curtains and blinds over all the windows in my house.  It was a several day job and it didn't drain during the day. I charged it overnight each time even though it wasn't necessary.Today I received this heavier duty drill and was pleased to find the same 20 volt lithium battery.  The new charger is considerably more compact, so that's really nice. The charger still uses the same blinking green light scheme to indicate it is charging and steady light to show it is fully charged.  The batteries came with a considerable charge, but not fully charged as expected.  It is really nice they included an extra battery.  And the overall price is just about what you would expect.This drill has a bright white LED light that illuminates when you pull the trigger. That seems a little after the fact in my opinion. The primary time you need the light is to position the drill before you start drilling. I checked the manual and there is no way mentioned to turn the light on without the drill being engaged.  There is a snap-in location above the battery for a double ended screwdriver attachment - one end is Philips head and the other end is a conventional flat blade screwdriver head.Compared to my other Black and Decker 20 volt lithium drill, this one is noticeably heavier - apparently due to a bigger DC motor. If you have a lot of overhead work, it may induce fatigue after a while. Using my scales, it weighs about 3.6 pounds compared to my other Black and Decker drill's 2.8 pounds with the same exact battery. The compact battery snaps onto the drill base solidly. I certainly prefer owning two compact batteries than one big battery.  At least one can be charging at all times. Except for the most heavy uses, I think this battery combination is far preferable to a single big battery. I just ordered a\u00a0Black & Decker BDCCS20B 20-volt Max Circular Saw Bare Tool, 5-1/2-Inch. It appears that it uses the same battery. Since I have three 20 volt batteries, this circular saw is a good choice to use my spare battery.This drill has the ubiquitous keyless chuck and torque selector found on most drills. Another nice feature is a dual speed gearbox. You can gear this one down for heavy duty applications or situations where you want a greater degree of control.  You can easily control the variable speed in both gearbox positions. And there is the conventional forward and reverse selector shaft. Another nice feature with this new drill is that there are a rubberized areas for the grip and head surrounding. It offers a nice feel to the grip and maybe it will help keep the case from cracking if you drop it. This drill comes with a nice soft case, but I prefer it had been a hard molded case. But the B&D hard case I bought earlier easily houses both drills, batteries and chargers.For most all household tasks, I believe this drill and battery pair is ideal. Now that I have two drills and three interchangeable batteries, I think I am more than equipped to do anything around my home.  Now I need to sell my NiCad and NiMH battery powered drills before the batteries fail. Lithium batteries are the only way to go. You usually don't have to worry about the batteries being totally dead if you haven't charged them in a long time.  Normally they have enough residual energy to get you started while the other battery is charging. I believe this is a good deal.  Consider buying the circular saw, too.",

        "reviewText": "Through the years I've owned several types of drills ranging from Black & Decker to Milwaukee. Most did the job. Though the parent company of B&D owns just about everybody including DeWalt, the brand has never been known as a serious player in power tools. That is until the last couple of years.Out of the box, the Black & Decker BDCHP 220 comes packed with a charger, (2) 20 volt lithium batteries, (1) screw bit, (1) storage bag and instructions. The manufacturer tags a two year warranty on the drill. The orange & black nylon bag is average in quality with no accessory pockets or dividers. The drill base sports a bit holder. The instructions are pretty cut and dry.The charger is equipped with a green LED indicator. When charging it flashes green. When the battery is fully charged I get a solid green LED. I get a full charge in a couple of hours. As an owner of both 36 and 20 volt lithium battery powered Black & Decker gear, it didn't take me long to realize that the real work horses are the 20 volt batteries.With the battery on board, this drill weighs in at a little over six pounds. Ergonomically, I like the feel and grip of this drill. The 24 position clutch is fluid and works as advertised. From start to finish overall torque is impressive. The single sleeve chuck keeps bits in check without any slippage. The two speed slide for the gear box is fluid. The mounted LED light is a major plus.From 350 to 1500 rpm this drill is no slouch. I put it to work immediately on my shed kit over the weekend. From start to finish I was able to get most of my 12' x 20' Dutch barn framed up and the floor done before I noticed a drop off in juice. Having the second battery charged allowed me to finish the roof, siding and the door install.If there were any improvements to be made it would be on a battery mounted LED power indicator. The company already installs LED power indicators on their 36 volt lithium batteries. Its an outstanding feature that has been proven both accurate and reliable. It would definitely move this drill to the top shelf.Like any tool the key is to know its limitations. Let's face it, this drill isn't going to win any awards for being a heavy duty work tool but it comes close. Its ideal for light and medium jobs around the house and Man Cave. That said, I'm still impressed with this drill. The folks at Black & Decker got this one right.",

The battery stays charged while not in use (unlike its predecessor with Ni-Cd batteries), so it's always ready to use.I find it comfortable in my hand and easy to control. It's a little heavier than my 14.4V Hitachi, but not oppressively so. The clutch works effectively, and the keyless chuck is quick and very easy to use.And what a bargain: rather than getting a replacement battery, it's just a few dollars more to get the drill, TWO batteries, and a charger. So I now have decent batteries that are compatible with my existing set of Skil 18-volt tools (but if you're in this situation, check compatibility carefully--it appears that there are two versions of the older 18-volt tools, and these batteries are compatible only with one of them).",

I used it several times and was happy with the performance but today it fell off of my step ladder from a height of four feet. It landed on my shingled roof and the plastic base that holds the battery broke off from the drill. If it had falled from a higher point or landed on concrete, I might be able to understand it breaking but to break under those circumstances is just ridiculous. Either buy a higher quality drill or be extremely careful with this one.",

The one feature that tipped me towards this drill was a review that rated this drill as the absolute best as far as maintaining constant torque over the speed range.  You don't often hear discussions about torque but in general it relates to control and this drill is very good in this area.The drill is also very well balanced and not overly heavy.  I think 15.6v is a nice compromise between battery power and weight.Panasonic did have problems with some early batteries and that is my one negative on this drill.  I was not able to get batteries replaced under warranty due to when they were determined bad.  I was able to build one good battery pack out of the two provided.  One good pack provides plenty of usability for most jobs.Note:  When I originally got this drill I was a bit disappointed in the battery life compared with my 9.6 volt Milwalkee.  Turns out there were dead/weak cells in both battery packs right from the start.  Unfortunately for me I did not determine this until it was out of warranty.  After fixing one pack up to be all good cells this baby performs extremely well.If you are going to do anything more that casual work or just enjoy using high quality tools you will love this drill!",

My only complaint is the friction mechanism for the keyless chuck is a bit noisy (a loud raspy sound when you're tightening the chuck).There are a lot of less-expensive models out there, but getting NiMH batteries (which charge up very quickly) is hard to do unless you spend a lot of money anyways.  I hope these batteries last a lot longer than the NiCad ones that seem to die after 2 years of even light use.

I was constructing some 2x4 shelves and dropped the drill on the chuck on cement and broken the chuck.  The drop was about 5' or so.  The problem is that the battery so outweighs the motor that it does not want to stay in a holster.  I replaced the chuck, though it did not work as well as the original for some reason.  Now, when set for drilling it will move the setting off drilling and start to slip.  The chuck does not want to hold bits like it used to as well.Recently I was drilling 2\" holes with a Forester bit (very tough going) in 2x6s and the motor started to smoke.  This drill is ruined now, as it smokes all the time.  It was clearly not up to the load imposed by drilling these.I love the feel and weight of this tool.  The batteries and charger have worked excellent by any standard.  I wish there was a little more heavy dutiness to it though.  I think people are buying this tool on the weight and battery life.  I know I did, but I would be cautious of the durability for heavy duty tasks.As a side not, there are some very good drivers coming out and I think I will try using two separate tools, a driver/impact driver and a drill.  The drivers/impact drivers are a lot lighter and would cover most of what I am doing and that would address my concern about lugging around a 5+ lb. tool most of the time.Good Shopping",

Over the last 21 years we have obviously seen about every cordless manufacturer out there. The employees are proud people and get quite competitive over who has the best drill. For many years we had quite a variety but for the last 3 or 4 years almost every single drill we buy is a panasonic. Bottom line is they have the best battery power and life second to none. They are built well and last through the abuse of day to day constant use. Our only warranty work that has been done on a few of them is the clutch but I attribute that more to heavy use than poor quality. The biggest debate we have is whether to get the 15.6 volt or the 18 volt and it's all about weight. The 18 volt is definately more powerful but a fair bit heavier also.

Whether you are a homeowner who occasionally need a power drill/screw driver or a DIY or a trademan, this tool is for you. It is versatile in tight confined spaces, too. It has enough torque for most screws, otherwise pre-drill a hole is just as easy and prevents shearing off the connector with a higher torque power tool.",

I reach for it every time I make some small installation in a clients home and it's compact size adds to it's versatility It's great for those small-to-mid-sized jobs at the finish level or just beyond, this drill won't be punching through that stud with an auger, hole saw, 3/4\"+ spade bit(s) etc. This will sort through your work w/ a 1/2\" twist bit or 5/8\" spade. Good speed, adequate torque, power & control, for a 12v, 'situation specific' tool. Available XC  battery, 5 year tool warranty, heavy/solid, easy to use. I prefer the 3/8\" chuck over 1/4\" hex quick-change on a tool like this because it allows us to 'fine tune' fasteners by hand-tightening them at the end. Complaint(s): with roughly 11 ft/lbs. of torque and an electronic clutch I couldn't give this tool the 5'th star. I haven't found anything else to complain about however. Definitely a recommended buy for anyone in the assembly, electrical, handyman or cabinet business' and the like.",

Milwaukee is one of my favorite tool brands.  My other milwaukee tools are very well-built and well-designed.  This 2415-20 is no exception.

My M12 drill also does this+ Enough power to easily drill through wood with a spade bit+ Ergonomic grip; very comfortable to use this toolCons:- Torque isn't adjustable, so you have to pay attention when driving screwsI bought this to get between studs where my drill couldn't fit.  It does this perfectly and is well built, like my other milwaukee tools.  Very highly recommended.",

Before getting this corresponding Drill/Driver, I hesitated, largely for sentimental reasons: my Panasonic EY6100 was such a smooth performer, I resisted the notion that it had been technically surpassed. But, I have to say, in the PS-31 the Bosch engineers have come up with another marvel. In drilling mode, the PS-31 delivers an impressive amount of torque for its compact size. In driver mode, the multi-position clutch does its job just fine (although I far prefer the PS-41 for driving tasks).The PS-31 handles well, and is a good fit for its mission profile. I'd give it 5 stars, except for a few niggling operational details. It's a bit top-heavy. I find my grip sliding up to compensate, which places a finger over the directional control switch (which is too loose for my tastes.). The PS-31's chuck has come in for a fair amount of discussion (the \"runout\" issue). I found that, with a 12-inch long, 3/8 inch bit in place, tip wander was not a problem--almost imperceptible, but ever-so-slightly more than my Panasonic. And I have noted more sparking from the motor than I did from the Impact Driver; be careful around potentially explosive atmospheres.The PS-31 is handy, compact, portable, and powerful--a winner.",

This is a good choice that has many excellent features.  On the Amazon website, it is difficult to tell the difference between the Black and Decker \"120\" series drill and this \"220\" series drill, apart from the ~$10 higher price of the latter.  Ignoring the additional letters within each series, like \"FC\" (fast charge), the only difference between the two series that I know of is the presence of an additional feature/switch on the \"220,\" the \"dual gearing range.\"  If you don't know what this is, or don't understand its possible use, I suggest going to the Black and Decker website and downloading the instruction manual.  The location and function of this switch is clearly indicated in that manual.  That should help you decide if this extra feature, along with its small increase in price, is worthwhile.

The drills are good, the hedge trimmer is great, the weed whacker is good for light work but is also a joy to use. The great advantage of the garden implements is their light weight. The whacker goes about 15 min on a fully charged battery but after going through 2 batteries I have had enough anyway. The hedge trimmer cuts very well and weighs only about 5 lbs as does the whacker. The light weight really makes the job go easier and one gets less tired. Good products.",

I'm happy with it so far - light enough and more than enough power.But two cons: 1. there's only one bit holder.  I'm always switching between Philips and square drive bits.  And 2. one time, driving a tough screw, a puff of smoke came from the motor vents at the rear. I quit immediately, waited a few minutes, then continued working.  It's been fine since, but.....?",

(Roughly 5 hours at my best guess since ive only charged it once, and that was about a month ago.) I would recommend this to any DIY's since it has plenty of power to do around the house work. Drill lasts a long time on one charge, and fits great in the hand. Like I said the only thing that bugs me is the charging time but that is it. Here are a few things I have done with it: put together a crib, drill and hang window blinds, hang paintings, and also some curtains.

Before getting this corresponding Drill/Driver, I hesitated, largely for sentimental reasons: my Panasonic EY6100 was such a smooth performer, I resisted the notion that it had been technically surpassed. But, I have to say, in the PS-31 the Bosch engineers have come up with another marvel. In drilling mode, the PS-31 delivers an impressive amount of torque for its compact size. In driver mode, the multi-position clutch does its job just fine (although I far prefer the PS-41 for driving tasks).The PS-31 handles well, and is a good fit for its mission profile. I'd give it 5 stars, except for a few niggling operational details. It's a bit top-heavy. I find my grip sliding up to compensate, which places a finger over the directional control switch (which is too loose for my tastes.). The PS-31's chuck has come in for a fair amount of discussion (the \"runout\" issue). I found that, with a 12-inch long, 3/8 inch bit in place, tip wander was not a problem--almost imperceptible, but ever-so-slightly more than my Panasonic. And I have noted more sparking from the motor than I did from the Impact Driver; be careful around potentially explosive atmospheres.The PS-31 is handy, compact, portable, and powerful--a winner.",

The two batteries that came with the combo are plenty so I went with just the bare tool on this drill, no need for a third battery. The combo driver kit and this drill all for around $200 is a nice deal for a set of great quality tools. The PS31 is powerful, nicely balanced and is great for any DIY project big or small. All Bosch tools have a very high quality feel and appearance to them. I also bought a Bosch oscillating tool kit through Amazon and am very pleased with that also.",

I love those tools but like many others have commented, the drill function was not the best feature and I had a lot of drill bits that I couldn't use with them. My older 3/8\" drill was heavy, bulky and on its last legs. I bought the bare tool because I had an extra battery and didn't need another charger. I could not be happier with my purchase. The PS31 is the right size, very powerful and suits my needs much better than my big old drill.

Time will tell if it holds up. My last Ryobi drill went for about 6 years with fairly heavy use, so - can't complain. Why the color change though? I liked the old blue and gold better.

So far it has failed and only left me with a slightly painful sprain,  I have used plenty of corded drills that would not do that.  For the size and weight of this drill I haven't seen anything that comes close to it.  So be careful using this drill.  There is no need for the large batteries as the 2.0 Ah batteries last a long time and charge quickly.  The quick stop brake and light are some of my favorite features so that just shows you can't please everyone.  I got this one to replace the 780 model that was stolen and there is a big difference between the two.  However the 780 is a fine drill also and unless you need the extra power and run time for such things as drilling steel the 780 will suffice for most users.",

That will mean alot after I've used it all day! Hoping the battery has a better charge than Craftsman!",

It is a good tool, for a homeowner to buzz around the house and make minor repairs with etc., but don't expect it to say, build a deck or something like that, that requires heavy steady usage. I too, (like everyone else) am suffering the recession fallout, so when my 18V Dewalt cordless hammer drill pooped out, I could not afford to replace it and bought this. I paid 69.99 on Amazon and later found it on e-bay for 49.99 and was upset at that point. But, I do trust Amazon anyday, before I would trust e-bay, who knows where your items came from on ebay, (returns, etc). Atleast you know it is brand new on Amazon. It still is a descent little drill though and for homeowner use only on small projects only, I would then give it 5 stars. Flashlight is handy also, bits it comes with are cheaper quality, batteries are pretty good though and will hold a good charge for you. I would say buy it if your intentions are light to medium usage.",

My other drills are Porter Cable and Craftsman. I find myself grabbing this one for more uses than I bought it for just because it feels so good in my hand. It has good power for the voltage, a decent chuck, and decent battery life. It also has a nice weight to it, not too heavy not too light. The charger charges the battery in around a half hour. The light is good as well. It has an adjustable lamp on it for all the various angles you may need it in. The case is nice as well. All said this is a great drill for the money.

This will be my 3rd identical drill and my current two are still going strong.  I couldn't pass up the chance to get another one of these great cordless drills with 2 more batteries for less than the price of the batteries alone.These drill have plenty of torque, last a long time on a charge, and the batteries recharge really fast.  The flashlight is also a very useful accessory.  Though, I have never used it as a flashlight, it is fantastic to drain the batteries down to zero charge every 4th of 5th time to refresh the ni-cad batteries.  Ni-cad batteries develop a \"memory\" when they are charged repeatedly without being drained.  Eventually, the charge won't last much past the normal use time.  Draining the batteries occasionally refreshes them.",

Couldn't ask for a better drill.  His has lasted a long time.  It's comfortable to hold, and has the power you need for all around-the-house jobs.Don't let your batteries completely discharge before you recharge them!  My dad has always done this, but I read in my manual that this isn't the recommended practice.  In fact it can reduce the life of the batteries.  The manual says to recharge them as soon as they noteably start to lose power.  In fact, my dad's batteries have lost the ability to keep much of a charge.",

I'm most impressed with the Ni-Cad battery.  It lasts much longer than the other drill batteries I've used--and I've used a few.  It also charges much faster than the others.  I debated buying a cordless drill with Li-Ion batteries, but bought this one instead.  I'm sure I've made the right choice.  I don't use a drill enough to warrant the price of the Li-Ion batteries, and I don't see how they could be much better than this one anyway.  I recently hung some sheetrock.  By the time my battery needed changing, the other one was completely recharged.  Every time.  This is a good product and a very good deal.",

I did a bit of research before I bought and decided an 18-volt drill was best for our very light household needs. If anything, it is probably more than we need, but I'm glad to have the extra power. The battery lasts longer than we've ever needed it to and it is pretty much idiot-proof, which is best for us.",

For wooden furniture crack repair I equipped this drill with a Bosch cobalt-tipped drill and a universal drill screwdriver bit set along with a box of driving screws. Drilled and screwed in to wood like a Knife through butter.I was concerned about how hard it's working to achieve this ease. Over 30 minutes of intermittent spooling there was a burnt smell coming from the slots covering the motor. Also, another concern is the blister causing trigger. Now I have work gloves , though when fixing a bed frame or a weight-bearing table I did not expect that level of effort to result in a blister - that's what happened. I would advise to either play it safe with gloves on any job spanning longer than 20 minutes or perhaps an impact driver is better suited. Anyway, one star off due to the drill's apparent weak motor and blister causing design on the trigger.",

But, this M-18 volt line up (have drill also) has completely gone time and again over what my expectations for it were. I added this to the tool fleet as an addition and to be replacement for a 3/8\" anvil 12 volt Dewalt that has been outstanding for 3+ years of commercial service life. The Dewalt batteries are getting bad and I figured a little more power in the next one would be good. Having a Milwaukee Sawzall that's been through WW3 and came back fine after 10 years I had no trouble buying Red. The first time I used this impact I knew that it was going to be without a doubt my new go to tool. I have learned that now I use this as tear down tool and use the 12 volt Dewalt as an assembly tool because this thing is so torquey it's hard to tell how much you're over tightening your fasteners. Breaks 1/4-20 bolts with ease and I have broke a few 5/16\" bolts that were rusty.",

Each drill has a little different feel, but I rate both drills as exceptional. The Bosch is a little lighter and a little smaller due to a more compact battery pack, but I often use them side by side with different drill sizes or one with a screwdriver bit. If you already have the batteries, this should be a no brainer. My only recommendation to stay away from 12 volt battery tools of all makes. You need to have the 18 volt to get the power youneed. My only issue is that I really need a third battery so I can always have a fresh one.",

The other tools have been great, except that the impact driver seems a little under-powered compared to similar brands.  This compact drill may be fine for home use, but is not built to the same quality of the rest of the M18 line and I would not recommend for any serious work.  The motor would overheat easily with paddle bits of any size, and recently the motor failed after two holes with a fresh 2\" hole saw (which this tool is rated for in the manual).  The Makita compact drill on site finished the other dozen or so holes with no issue.  The motor on this model is framed which leads to poor cooling and higher temperatures; after disassembly i found the resin bonding the coil to the motor shaft and fan had burnt and cracked apart.  The other drills and impact drivers in this line have different frameless motors.",

The day after I got it for him he spent three hours putting 3\" screws into our new subfloor joists (the drilling went on forever) and didn't even use two full battery charges. This is his first cordless tool in twenty years. He says the current cordless technology (lithium) is amazing and the reason why we will be converting to all cordless power tools in the future.I love writing positive reviews for quality products!Good job, Dewalt!",

        "reviewText": "This is an excellent compact drill. It's lightweight, a little less than 3-1/2 pounds. The ergonomics are excellent, it feels great in your hand. It's easy to use overhead, or with your arm extended.It has two speeds, 0-600 rpm and 0-2000 rpm. The 2000 max rpm is fast for a cordless drill. 2000 rpm is great for drilling small holes, soft woods, or plastics. The faster the speed you can run, the faster you can drill the hole. (of course you don't want to use a higher than recommended rpm for the material or drill bit you're using)The drill has a 1/2\" chuck that runs dead true. I've seen a couple of reviews that talk about chuck runout, but my drill and the two we have at work run dead true. I take excellent care of my drill, but the two at work see hard usage without any problems.The drill has 15 clutch settings to give you great control when driving screws. It comes with two 1.5 Ah lithium ion batteries that are small, light, yet powerful. The batteries charge in 30 minutes, have excellent runtime and hold their charge well while stored. Even the included hard case is well thought out. It is compact and holds everything securely. The drill also comes with a belt clip and a bit holder. Both are removable and can be assembled on either side of the drill.The drill has an LED light that stays on about 20 seconds after you release the trigger. The placement of the light could be a little better as the light is somewhat blocked at the point of use by the chuck. The Bosch compact cordless drill (DDS181-02) has the light down at the base of the handle and is angled up to a point out in front of the chuck. That method works better. I had originally purchased the Bosch, but took it back and replaced it with this DeWALT. Don't get me wrong, the Bosch is a very good drill with plenty of power. To me It just didn't have the fit, feel, or build quality of the DeWALT.Additional (and maybe even useful) information:This is not the most powerful drill in its class. It may have traded some torque for higher speed. I think that its a good trade off in a compact drill.DeWALT is bringing the assembly of this model drill back to the USA (North Carolina). They will have information on their website. I've had mine for almost a year so it isn't USA assembled.DeWALT has a new 20 volt max brushless compact drill model DCD790C2. Be sure to check it out before you close the deal on a new cordless drill.Also, if you're looking at compact drill drivers you may want to check out the 12 volt offerings from DeWALT, Milwaukee, Bosch, and Makita. They are less powerful, but smaller and lighter.",

It is my drill of last resort primarily because of a poor chuck that is difficult to tighten and does not hold bits securely ( my other drills are Bosch and Makita). I agree with the other reviewer that the pictures of screws and drills are useless. I just turn the ring until something works. Your basic 1/2 switch for speed would have been much better. I've been very happy with the other 20V tools, except for the tiller which doesn't do much.",

        "reviewText": "I bought this 20 volt Lithium-Ion drill at WAL-MART and \"it\" came with only one battery.  The complete kit was about the same price, for just \"one\" battery for my Milwaukee Ni-Cad drill. I already have a \"white\" Makita lithium-Ion Impact Screw driver - (VERY IMPRESSIVE) and expensive! (Its just not designed for using drill bits to drill holes). IMPACT screw driving is the \"only' way to go when it comes to \"driving-in\" screws!  The battery on this Black-Decker takes a \"LONG\"-(MUCH TOO LONG) time to re-charge, the reason why is because its charger is putting out only (0.2 amps.) I guess the manufacture thinks that will make the battery last longer?  My Makita will charge the same size battery in under (15 MINUTES)! But it's Charger is putting out (9.0 amps)!  OK - now to see how this Black-Decker performs. First I made sure the battery was fully charged -(this took over 4 hours) before there was a steady green \"ON\" light on the charger, (MUCH TOO LONG)!!!  WHAT's THIS!? - What \"Knuckle-Head\" design engineer took away the seperate (High-Low) switch that can be engaged at any torque setting? One does not need photographs of different size screws - \"That\" kind of information is \"USELESS\" because of the varying hardness of different woods and materials. \"COME-ON\" Black-Decker - take that person who thought up that idea out of that department and put them somewhere else! Its making you look \"BAD\". \"GO BACK\" to the \"Standard\" clutch chuck that we all have come to love. I bet from all the bad reviews you are getting on this set-up - this will be the last model with this type of clutch/hi-low set-up - its crap!  There is alot of forward and reverse \"slack\"(free movement) when hand turning the chuck back an forth -I knew this drill would not be in the same \"Class\" as  Milwaukee/Makita/Dewalt products when I bought it, but to have a \"spare\" drill, you can not beat the price.  I am very impressed at the \"POWER\" this drill has and its light weight - The chuck does not hold round drills very well, unless you put the \"Arnold Swarz\" torque on them!Something the female gender is not capable of, as well as some of the male gender. Buyer's of this drill will be alot happier buying a set of those (3-flat sided) drill bits! (Which works much better than round bits in \"ANY\" drill!  I am very impressed at how long the drill runs on one charge - this is \"MORE\" than enough time for most any home project! You really dont need an extra battery, unless it is a very big project.  Only time and use will truely test this drill - But I can say for now that \"I LIKE it\". This is a great price for a Lithium-Ion Drill! - Lithium-Ion is the only way to go for now - it is worth the extra expence when compared to Ni-Cad which has seen its days.  This is a great buy for someone on a limited budget, or rarely uses a drill.  But if a person needs a drill for heavy-duty construction - \"TRUST ME\" bite the bullet, save your money and get a Makita/Milwaukee/Dewalt - you will not reget it - every time you use it there will be a smile on your face at how it performs!",

Unfortunately, the driver stripped different screws on both pieces of furniture and I had to assemble by hand. The autosense stopped the drill while the screw was about a quarter-inch out and then the continuation beyond that stripped the screw. I read a review that says that if you keep the trigger at the same pressure it will continue to pulse driver after it initially stops but that was too hard to remember to do, and I don't know if that would work. I just know that the drill stopped, I released the trigger, and then started it again and that's when it stripped the screws. Good luck if you think you are able to not release the trigger when it first stops. Also B&D only gives you one generic driver with this expensive purchase, which frankly stinks. I am planning on returning it.",

I have liked the products but the batteries always never seemed to last for more than a couple of hours. I bought this model because of the 20 Volt lithium battery and thought that if it didn't last more than a few hours I would take it back. I was really surprised that after 2 days of constant use putting on pickets for a fence that was almost 80 feet long that it still had a charge. Well, it was down to what I guess was 1/4 charge. I cannot believe for the price what a good product this is.",

The adjustable clutch is great to do a good job without stripping the screw, etc.  I bought some of the other adapters to convert it to 2 different types of saws.

The reason I purchased this combo, is, I figured I would be using the flashlight more then the drill and it's a wast to have a charged battery. :)I have not really used the drill, as I purchased an oscillating head for it.  I have used that comb more then the drill and it has worked out wonderfully.I am disappointed that only one battery is provided.  In the past, usually two batteries were included (as I recall).  I have not used it enough to know how long the battery will last.  I estimate w/ the oscillating tool, I had a total of 30 min of estimated use (used it in small increments, so an exact time is not know, only as estimate).It would have been nice if the combination would have included a case, but did not.  I feel the flashlight/drill combo is ideal for most homeowners.  If you don't use your drill, as I said, it's a waste of a battery...so the flashlight is a great accessory.Distance wise, the flashlight does not go far.  But it lights up a wide area.  I would say it is at least 10 feet wide and 10 feet in front.  After that, the light fades away.  It is bright enough to use during the day time, as I used it in a pickup engine compartment.  The rotating light allows you to position the flashlight and adjust as needed.The main reason I didn't give it full stars was the fact it only had one battery.",

        "reviewText": "My last drill was a 19.2 volt Craftsman, and definitely not top-of-the-line, but f I wasn't already married I would marry this drill. It is beautiful, dependable, powerful, and always gets the job done. I am not a contractor or anything, but I always have several home/rental projects going, and this drill has handled them all. The light is helpful, the clip is fantastic, and the drill itself (with small battery) is not too heavy for me (135 lb female).The only downside is that you have to get used to how powerful it is if this is your first drill, or your last one wasn't very powerful. I have a tendency to pull too hard on the trigger when changing bits and it goes really fast. Want it to open just enough for that small screwdriver attachment? Take it nice and easy. I have never had a problem while actually drilling.I definitely recommend this drill to anyone who wants one drill for all their home projects (it might be strong enough for commercial use, but I can't attest to that).",

        "reviewText": "I love using this drill though there are some things I have to get used to.  If you have the drill at full speed and let go of the trigger, it doesn't seem to engage a clutch to stop.  It seems to put itself in \"park\" much like you would do in a car, and the sound of it is like slamming a crowbar into a gearbox.  I'm sure the designers knew what they were doing and it's not harming the mechanism, but it is a little disconcerting to hear that clunk to a dead stop in under a second.As for the drill itself, very powerful, very well balanced, and easy to use.  The torque control seems to work well, but as many have complained in previous reviews, the chuck tends to loosen up during use - you need to really tighten it well before you start, or the drill bit or screwdriver bit could fall out on you.  Other than that, I love it.",

        "reviewText": "This brushless drill (and the matching DCF895D2 impact driver) are the most powerful hand tools I've ever used.  And the smaller, lighter 2.0 Ah lithium battery pack lasted ALL DAY drilling thousands of 5/32\" x 4\" screw holes before requiring a recharge (plus, many 3/16\" x 10\" screw holes too). You would only need the 4.0 Ah battery if you were not planning on recharging for a couple days! For real, these brushless motors are so much more powerful and efficient that battery size and weight can be halved, making the tool much easier to balance and handle.The all steel chuck is perfect match too.  About the only improvement would be courser chuck knurling to improve hand grip (the finer knurling is near impossible to hold with the power of this drill, and can literally burn while spinning in your hand).  Thankfully, it doesn't take much grip to create a super tight, non slipping hold on any drill bit.  Awesome tool.  The most improvements I've ever seen...and all at once!",

I've had drills that cost over twice what this one does and this drill can do everything and more that those drills can. Like a Dewalt or Milwaukee etc. with an all metal gear box and 400 inch pounds of torque this is a lot of bang for your buck. You don't need to spend $200 to get a quality tough hard working drill that is suitable for most professional or home jobs. Unless you're going to be doing a lot of drilling through heavy steel this will do the job for you. Not that this drill won't drill through steel but for that kind of continued use you'd want a heavier drill with around 600 inch pounds of torque. I bought this drill to replace my old Quantum Pro hammer drill and was worried that not being a hammer drill I would have problems on the occasions when I need to drill through concrete block, tile or cement but this drill does all that effortlessly. You'll be happy if you buy this drill at the money you saved and knowing you got a quality work tool.",

Gets the job done perfectly, no questions asked.I have tested this tool for drilling into Wood, brick, concrete slabs and will do with ease.For driving, it is as easy as it can get.  One of the main advantages is with the super fast charger and the 20v battery that comes with it. I use these batteries interchangeably with other black&decker wireless tools, makes my life more easy.The only flaw that I observe is that the LED could have been brighter (I guess everyone wants more light)What made me buy this? And the answer isThis is highly rated tool for DIY stuff (consumer rating), ease of use, weight as a consideration but not to compare with much lighter ones and lastly awesome customer service.",

        "reviewText": "This kit is a excellent replacement for the classic 9.6 Nicad Makita drill kits.The only bummer is you don't get the awesome ratcheting flashlight.The 3 main pluses are 1 pound lighter, and the lithium ion batteries keep their charge better while \"shelfed\", i.e. sitting idle, waiting for the next use.The third reason is ergonomics. These truly fit like a glove in you hand. Think the old 9.6 felt good? Try one of these new drill. I bet you will be thoroughly amazed.Lithiums have next to zero self discharge-the common problem with Nicads.Besides the weight, that's the main draw back of Nicads, especially after a couple of years. Don't use the drill for a couple months, and you need to recharge before you use it.In my experience, the life span with these newer lithium's should be more or less the same as the Nicads.They are also fairly inexpensive if you shop around, more or less the same as the old 9.6 nicads.I have both the older(9.6 volt)  nicad drill, and this, and find myself using this newer drill more often, as it's always charged and ready to go. The 3 cell lithium setup of this 12 volt series require less electronics-thus less cost.The power vs weight vs cost is darn near perfect-just like the old nicad 9.6 setup vs the larger nicad drills.That's were these drills really shine-a perfect, or near perfect balance.IMHO for many users, these drills will do about 90% of your tasks-but they aren't a 18 volt-which has at least twice the torque (nor will they have the run time with out a recharge) drill-so buy wisely for your intended tasks.The size, balance, and weight savings of this compact drill really does make a difference in much less operator fatigue over always using a 18 volt or larger drill.I was always sold on the Makita 9.6 nicad setup, but  I am slowly coming around to this new technology, as the prices are starting to fit better then a couple years ago.",

I was a finish carpenter and custom cabinet maker for years, and I used Porter Cable almost exclusively. Porter Cable is part of the old Rockwell brand, their handheld tools now being made under the Porter Cable name and their stationary tools as Delta. This cordless drill will last you a life time, though the Nickel Cadmium batteries are not the latest technology, they will last for years. Some of the things that I like about this tool, is the wide range of torque settings that you have, and the trigger lock that is engaged when the forward and reverse switch is in the middle position. This set also comes with two batteries, so you always have one fully charged, and it also comes with the carry bag, which is better than a box, because it is much roomier and you can fit all of the  boxes of screws, drill  bits, and screw driver  bits in it with room to spare. This is definitely the best buy I have seen in a long time. Do yourself a favor and pick one up.",

The Hitachi batteries are less expensive and the tool seems more powerful. Great Item.",

The advantages of the lithium battery cannot be understated; I used this drill for over a month regularly on the charge that came from the factory! Then I switched to the 2nd battery included and got another few weeks out of it before charging it once!The handgrip is comfortable, the LED light is VERY handy, and the drill has plenty of power for an everyday handyman. The included bits are not of the highest quality, but they work fine for most applications. The overall tool construction feels very solid & I expect to get many years of use out of it. It's plenty rugged; I've even used the butt of it as a makeshift hammer in a pinch once or twice!The carrying case keeps everything nice & neat without a lot of rattling around & parts tumbling inside. i keep several extra bits & tons of screws in the case at all times & there is plenty of room.I really, really love this drill/driver and would recommend it to anyone. Great job, Hitachi!",

One of the batteries started not holding a proper charge after about a year, I thought this was rather short battery life. The second battery is still going strong. The drill is not overly heavy and does have plenty of power and the battery lasts a fairly long time between charges. My major complaint, other than the one battery going bad, is the chuck. It is difficult to tighten enough so that the bit will not slip. I have several other drills and they seem to have much better chucks. As I said, this drill is not bad for a budget price but the next one I buy will be with lithium ion batteries and a higher quality drill.",

I especially like it for drywall because of its size and the fact that it has a belt clip.  My first one has seen a lot of use in the four years I have had it and the battery packs are still well over 50 percent.  More that I can say for some other cordless drills I have had.  Keep in mind that it is a 12 volt and as such is limited in the jobs it is designed for.  I have stronger drills for the big jobs.

This is not at all clear in the product description and completely ignored in the very brief owner's manual.The hex drive fits standard driver bits and extensions.  The only way to drill with this tool is to buy those odd drill bits with hex fittings on them, or to buy a separate chuck that fits the hex drive.Weirdly there is no mention of this in the \"accessories\" section of the manual, although Makita makes one that Amazon sells.Had I realized this I may well have chosen a different driver/drill as the chuck is another $25 or so.Having said this, the driver is extremely small and lightweight, which is what I'm looking for.

        "reviewText": "I've owned a good many power drills in my life, starting with the old school 9.6v Makitas in the early 90s through 12v, 14.4v and 18v Makitas and DeWalts. This is hands down the most versatile drill I've ever owned.Right now I work as a Systems Administrator for a tech company and sometimes I need to install racks of servers. I recently had to travel around the US and Europe installing small clusters and this drill was excellent for the task. Now, mostly I was just screwing in bolts, but still the amount of torque this baby could put out was impressive. The batteries also last forever and charge quickly. Beyond that, the drill is so small that you can get it into tight spaces.I also own a BDF452HW (the 18v Li-Ion version) and it's great if you're actually doing real construction with drill bits and driving screws into wood, but it's a lot bigger and heavier (still lighter than most). For most small jobs this drill will do everything you need.The only small quibble I have is that the charger that comes with this drill doesn't work at 220v. It's really a stupid oversight on Makita's part. Having to lug around a transformer when in Europe is just lame. It's seriously the only thing I had with me that didn't have a power supply that automatically switched voltages.",

I definitely prefer these for most jobs over the 18volt units because the 18volt drills are so heavy.  I definitely recommend this anyone in the market.  I know this is the same text as my other review for the combo kit.  I liked it so much I bought this driver as well.",

I was able to get it on a special offer for $129.00, so I don't think I could go wrong.The ONLY things so far that don't seem very well thought out is: it comes with a metal belt clip that you can attach with a small screw. Great idea, very handy especially if your on a ladder or have to grab or hold something.The thing is, the drill WILL NOT fit into the case with the clip attached...you have to remove it. Won't be doing that every time I get working on something. Dumb.Also, The case is really nice, but there is a LOT of wasted space in it. there are a couple of hollow areas that are filled in with plastic, so they are unusable for storing drill bits etc. My last Milwaukee drill just had a plain metal case with a removable tray, it allowed me to take all by bits and drivers with me in one case. With the Bosch, I had to buy a separate little tool box just to hold all the attachments.Hope this helps!",

Wow, have these things changed.  Always in the past I have use a cordless for relatively light tasks and have found them to be very handy or I have used them for drilling pilot or other small holes while using one of my corded drill for bigger holes or tough materials. They have all lasted 3 or 4 years and then the batteries no longer hold a charge well enough to be useful.  It always seems that replacing the batteries is so expensive that I procrastinate a while and then buy a new drill.

        "reviewText": "I've been through quite a few of the 12 volt max drill/drivers looking for the right one for me.I tried several including the hitachi DS10DFL, the bosch PS31-2A and the milwaukee 2401-22 and all were lacking in one way or another for my preference (the hitachi has a double sleeve chuck which I don't like, the bosch was nice but the grip was a bit uncomfortable for me and the milwaukee is too top heavy and not much lighter than my 18 volt drill).The Dewalt DCD710S2 hits all my requirements:* Powerful. It's handled everything I've thrown at it with no issues and I never felt like I was taxing the drill or motor. In all the tool tests I've found online the dewalt consistently places among the best. I really like that it has a top speed (1500 rpm) that's faster than most of the other 12 volt drills out there.* Comfort. The handle is smaller than the drills where the battery goes into the handle so it's much more ergonomic and comfortable for all day usage. The rubber grips assist in making the drill a pleasure to hold and use. The trigger is very responsive throughout the speed range; I never feel like I don't have control over the speed of the drill. The speed switch on top works fine; it's stiff enough where deliberate effort is required to change speeds, but not too stiff where you mangle your fingers trying to change speeds. The forward/reverse selector is a bit loose for my preference. It functions just fine, but wiggles a bit. It hasn't been an issue during use. The batteries are flat and attach at the bottom very securely with a strong spring loaded latch.  I really like that I can stand the drill up and not worry too much about it tipping over. The LED works fine. A slight press of the trigger will make the light come on for lining up your driver bit. A ring light like on the DCF610S2 would be nice but really isn't feasible because of the nature of a drill chuck.* Batteries and charger. Two 1.5AH batteries and a 30 minute charger give me all the juice I need for around the house and workshop use. A note about the batteries; they used to be 1.3AH but are now 1.5, and to make it even better, they use the same cells as the milwaukee red lithium batteries. But rather than make a big marketing ordeal about it, dewalt simply changed the label on the 12 volt max tools and batteries and called it a day. See the pics I uploaded for details.* Belt hook. I never used to use belt hooks, nor did I prefer them for my cordless tools, but the hook on the dewalt is great. It's sturdy, out of the way, and allows for hanging on a belt during use or a nail for storage. Very useful.* Storage bag. It's ok. It holds the drill, charger and extra battery with no problems, though I wish there was a divider or some velcro straps in there so everything wasn't free to knock into each other during transport.So overall I haven't been this satisfied with a tool since I bought the original bosch PS20 that started the sub-compact craze.There is room for improvement though; I'd like to see a better bag with some way to hold the tools in place and a forward/reverse switch that doesn't wiggle as much.Also, with milwaukee having the XC batteries for its M12 line, I could easily visualize dewalt doing the same for their 12v max line. The batteries would be the same as they are now, just a bit taller for the extra cells.Quick add-on: I forgot to mention this in the review originally, but another plus is that with the newer 12v max tools (the ones with the yellow labels) dewalt switched from the map-style manual to a traditional staple-bound manual. Kudos to dewalt for this. :-)",

Since I'm not a power user, I've never used it long enough to go thru a full charge, just a few minutes here or there. But it's always got power when I grab it, seems I rarely ever have to charge the battery, so I 'know' shelf drain is minimal to non-existent.* LED Light - first unit I've ever owned with that feature, but boy, it sure has come in handy a couple of times. Bright and effective when you need it, and no bother at all when you don't.Cons - zero, none, nodda. This thing is perfect.",

My old 9.6V Dewalt was 'grip strength' and I sometimes didn't crank it enough such that it would open if I reversed and there was tension on the bit in the wood. The new models have a ratchet chuck that is easy to tighten.The 12V cost little more than 2 new batteries for the 9.6V it replaced and it came with 2 batteries, not a difficult decision to get the 12V. In fact, two 9.6V batteries cost 10% MORE than a new 9.6V drill WITH 2 batteries. Go figure. The Dewalt chargers are 'interchangeable'. Multiple voltages (7.2 to 18V) and the batteries for the 12V have the same 'plug' configuration as the old 9.6V so I have 2 batteries AND two chargers.This drill has only 1 'holder' for screwdriver bits. Not a big deal, but I did like the \"one on either side\" bit storage on the 9.6V.",

I used it to for driving some 3.5\" framing screws and drywalled a bathroom, laundry room, and small hallway. It has plenty of power and balances well in the hand. The LED light is also a nice enhancement for dark corners in tight workplaces.",

I know its not an 18v like everyone raves about. but its light and well balanced. I dropped it many time. Iv drilled thou hardened steel with 3/8 bits and its never failed me yet. Its been a great companion iv used allot of 18v before and this thing is much eraser on the arm. of course more battery swamping but after completing a deck a few swaps is no big deal if your arm is not tired. Other thoughts i have a 14.4 hammer dewalt for larger jobs again that thing and do anything an 18v can do. just has less weight and of course shorter battery life. but again well worth it. lagging an 18v around is just stupidity if you don't need it for the job.",

        "reviewText": "I read all of the reviews stating this drill is under powered, but I bought it anyway. What I was looking for was something that could handle some basic household tasks. Minor drilling to hang blinds, disassembly and reassembly of furniture, that sort of thing. Unfortunately this \"drill\" is not up to task. The thing is essentially an oversize power screwdriver, as it cannot handle tasks more complex than that.Drill bits slip severely, as the prongs that grip are incapable of holding them. The seat at the bottom doesn't really work to hold the bit in place. This caused me some problems when drilling through very light wood in order to install hardware for blinds. This was some really light work, and this tool struggled. When it came time to drill into a stud to hang a TV mount, I really started wishing I had spent the additional money on a better drill. Occasionally the bit would get stuck in the wood, and I had to put the thing into reverse and forward to back the thing in and out repeatedly before it would get into the wood. All of this to drill three 2.25\" holes into a stud.After I finished that job, I moved onto mounting a handle on one of my kitchen cabinets. It was the same story with the drill bit, but I guess the stud work damaged the prongs and the bit had some more severe slippage with this job. At this point, it became clear that the tool would be relegated to light duty work assembling furniture and that sort of thing. For the actual work you see models doing in the product images, I am going to have to purchase a better drill.",

I got this in late spring and have built 230 ft of fence, 3 gates, 2 with arbors, a pergola and I'm half way through building a double Adirondack chair. That's in addition to various household and assembly tasks. The tool has worked fine throughout. Yes, the case is pretty cheap. It works.This drill replaces a 15 year old Makita that finally died after several battery replacements. I then bought a Craftsman 14.4 volt drill that I returned two days later. It was gutless. Being cheap I tried this drill, thinking that I could spring for another Makita or DeWalt. Thankfully, this does the job. It has enough torque to drive screws into treated fence posts. The batteries last longer than it takes to replace the backup. I've actually used the light in the attic. For what this is it's a good buy.",

I shopped around for a replacement, and love this package so far.  The cost is great, and everything in the kit has worked great.  I love that I have two batteries, multiple drill bits, quick charger, a portable STRONG flashlight, and a case to carry it all.  Plus, it has a slow and fast switch, so it doubles as an electric screwdriver.  Plus, the clutch.  What more could you ask for?It seems that all of the bad reviews were contractors that used a drill all day and dropped them off of ladders.  STOP DROPPING YOUR DRILLS!  :)  For the average or above average homeowner with jobs around the house, this is a great deal.",

Sometimes you need a small, compact, lite-weight tool to go where others can't. Inside cabinet drawers, in close 'inside-corners' or behind things that leave you little room. This tool has surprised me in it's capacity to do all the jobs the big heavy drills aren't adapted for. More power and torque than it's size and voltage suggest, adjustable torque for small screws, longevity of battery life, easy forward/reverse...and I can't get it to fail. Not once. In two years now.

This drill is perfect for me, I am always tightening and adjusting things around the apartment. I even have used it to drill holes in wood. The internal battery lasts for weeks of sporadic use before I have to plug it in.I especially like the switch between (high torque/high speed), and the 1 through 10 + drill setting. LED indicators are also very nice and intuitive.Also, I am a big guy (26, 6'2\", 200lbs) I was worried that the drill would be too small, but it's not at all.In fact, it is very comfortable, the kind of tool you want to use when you are on your back underneath the kitchen sink for an hour.",

The drill is easy to hold, not too heavy, and works well for small jobs around the house.  The only issue I have is with the drill bits that came with the drill.  They're not as effective as the bits I use in my other drill, but that's an easy fix, as I'm going to use the better bits for this drill.",

Now, my staff is pretty protective of their equipment, but they truly beat the crap out of these things...5 at a time, day in and day out. Salt air, rain, sand, etc. 365 days a year. I just recently bought my 2nd new drill in as many years, I have some that are pushing three years with the only maintenance being a little spray lube once a week or so. Every last part of this thing is comfortable, well designed, and above all else, reliable. My staff takes them for granted and is almost shocked if one has a problem. My opinion is that the all metal transmission is just the best in the business. I've tried others, good brands that are supposed competitors but they just can't hack it for more than 4-6 months. The batteries and chargers last forever, so once you buy one, if you somehow need a replacement you can buy the bare tool for about $75. There is a reason every professional vendor I see at the resort uses Dewalt as well. Simply the best , I will never use anything else.",

When i bought the dewalt drill i bought it with a combo. the sawzall,flashlight,drill and the circular saw. I know this supposed to be a review about the drill so am going to try to make it for the drill. I used the drill for almost anything.Drilling through metal, wood, drywall.I really put it to work. And it would do what you wanted. The only thing i didn't like is the plastic chuck component. After months of using it the cuck just wore out. it wouldn't catch to stop it from spining to tightenthe bit. Even when trying to release the bit.It would just spin. I was just dissapointed that it just wore out like that.The drill works really well. My friends drill did the same thing just wore out. He sent it in and they replaced it with a whole new chuck for 18 bucs.I didn't really feel like fighting with it. Didn't know how long the new chuck would last me if i was going to replace it. so i just went and bought a Craftman Drill Driver and its been doing the same jobs that my old dewalt would did.if the dewalt was a little cheaper i would of bought the heavier duty drill.",

Less Hand fatigue.(3) The Ridgid is more compact and smaller with more power.(3) The Rigid uses a 18V Lithium-Ion Battery instead of a 18V Ni-Cad Battery. There no comparison between the Lithium-Ion which leaves a Ni-Cad in the dust. It has more power, lasts longer and takes shorter time to charge.(4) The DeWalt has 3 or 5 year warranty. The Ridgid has a life-time Warranty.For a manufacture to give a Life-time warranty speaks for itself in the confidence of quality in the product.(5) There other minor advantages, but the con is, the Ridgid doesn't come with a Case. So I bought 2ea Husky cases for $9.98 a pair, while on sale.Both the DeWalt and the Ridgid were on Sale for $99.00 ea. at Home Depot (2010 after Black Friday sale). I don't know how long the sale will last. Even though I have a workshop full of both DeWalt & Ridgid tools I feel one should give credit when credit is due.",

The lithium-ion batteries charge in a very short time, and it came with a spare. It is rugged, well-balanced, has quite a bit of torque as well as speed, and is fairly priced. Time will tell, but so far I am impressed.One thing that is missing is a built-in level. This feature, found on a few drills, would be a big help for more accurate work.",

Great control of speed, etc.  Great usability and ergonomics.  Relative to the old Makita I'm replacing it's nicely small and light.  The only weakness is that the LED light is blocked by the chuck, so not really that useful.",

The batteries deliver enough power so that the tools are useful.  I have not had any power issues where I wished I had a plug in drill or tool.

The only reason this combo is worth the extra couple of bucks is to make some money selling the flashlight on eBay for more money.  To put such a large battery on a flashlight, you should expect to get a great beam or a large coverage of light.  I have a AA pocket flashlight I bought new for $5 that puts out more light than this.The drill/driverI purchased this drill to replace my Black and Decker Firestorm 24v drill as the batteries needed to be replaced and the product was discontinued. As with my retired drill, I was immediately attracted to the high voltage for those tough jobs. After taking the Matrix through its trials, I have some good things and bad things to say.First, as soon as you place this drill in your hand, you will immediately feel that this tool is quite light due to the lithium battery. It also has a great pistol grip that fits nicely in your palm. The forward and reverse is easily reachable, and the on board bit holder comes in handy. This drill/driver was able to go through a lot of wood on a single charge (recessed with Forstner bit, drilled pilot hole, and drove the screw for 60 holes until needing a charge). I am not able to give a review on the other attachments for this system and can't comment on their runtimes. I do however, believe that those attachments make this system a great addition to any home tool shop.There are, however, a few disappointments worth sharing. First, it takes more than 4 hours to recharge the battery and having a spare one is critical to tackle large projects. There is also a little piece of plastic that protrudes out in front of the clutch and makes adjusting it difficult. I'm sure this problem couldn't be avoided as I believe it's necessary for the other attachments but I feel it's a bad design. Even with the 20 volt lithium, I feel that this tool is underpowered. With my old cordless B&D Firestorm, I was able to get out the toughest screws and drill through the toughest materials like butter. With this one, I have already got the chuck to start spinning while the bit doesn't move at all. The matrix drill also doesn't have nearly the speed as the others. I find this a big problem when using it to drill through hard woods. 800rpm is just not enough.Even with these problems, I still gave this an 4 out of 5 star because its versatility factor. The ability to create a platform that allows for sanding, drilling, oscillating, driving, routing, lighting, cutting, impact driving, jigsawing, and more is brilliant. If the problems above are improved in the next models of this tool, I feel I will be a lifetime customer of this system.",

Second: the battery like other reviewer said the battery is expensive I know it has 2 years warranty but for $50 more, I got Rockwell RK2852K2 20V max, brushless motor, two 20V Lithium Batteries 2.0 AH that has free replacement program for life !!!, with 530in.Lb torque ,very nice and tight soft case, high quality Charger, I am very happy with the replacement the Rockwell looks and feels great in the hand solid build, metal chuck, with 10 year Brushless motor warranty, I know its like reviewing two items at the same time but I think spending this much money is worth it not only for a great drill but also the free replacement batteries for life, you cant beat that, check it out currently available at Menards with 11% discount.",

It comes with 2 batteries, which is a huge plus, because who wants to wait for your battery to charge in the middle of a project.  The design is eye catching, but then my top and main criteria are around performance.  That is where this cordless drill shines.  It has enough power to drill through any of the various materials I have needed it to.  It has a good battery life.  The adjustable torque is great for when you need to power up through some dense wood, or power down when putting in or removing screws.  At 3.5 pounds, it is light enough to hold for extended periods of time.  I have not used the included flashlight, but would come in handy when working in the attic, crawlspace, etc.This is a fantastic cordless drill to use around the house.",

The price was remarkable, and I wanted the diversity of a higher end tool over the basic intro model DeWalt 18 volt light model variable speed drill. I have used the hammer feature, not as powerfully as some other commenters, but I did find the hammer drill capability a very compelling additional feature to have available. I have since purchase a bare 18 volt impact wrench, and have found that to round out my DeWalt line up, and it is the new popular tool to have for really strong problem solving. I love this Hammerdrill/Drill/Driver - I love DeWalt tools! Don't hesitate if you're even pondering the question. Just get it!",

The grease gun and circular saw are ordered and on the way as well to round out my assortment.  I'm a \"heavy duty\" homeowner user who also uses his tools for occasional contracting jobs so I demand good quality out of my products and value for my money.The brushless drill is a complete dream to use.  The chuck is the modern metal ratcheting design that holds all sizes of bits tightly with no issues, the runtime is phenominal.  I assembled all of the framing on my 16'x20' pressure treated deck and didn't need to charge the batteries on any of my tools!  I used one battery and swapped it between a few tools and after 3 solid days of use it was finally down to 1 bar so I charged it, even though it was still working!  Torque is as good or better than the outgoing 18v DeWalt products and the features like speed switch, LED light, belt hook and so on all perform nicely.  Weight, look and feel is perfect, no complaints there either.If you're looking for a great quality product with impressive runtime, torque and features, look no further.",

This site confirmed the high torque rating for a similar Bosch model, so I bought it.

        "reviewText": "I've owned Dewalt, Ryobi, B&D, and now this Bosch drill.  The Bosch leaves me wanting nothing else in a drill.Pros & Cons as compared to the others I've owned (in this price range).Pros:1) Lighter weight and compact, with a very solid build.  This is well balanced, feels similar to my Ryobi lithium drill, but is slightly more compact.  Nice for squeezing it into tight spaces like cabinets.2) Plenty of space on the handle for a big hand.  These are built for man hands, and are comfortable to hold all day long.  When I'm working with my Dewalt, it feels like a giant brick in comparison to this drill.3) POWERFUL - One of the first tasks I used it for was driving 4\" screws to anchor a snack-bar into multiple layers of studs.  I pre-drilled the counter but not the studs, and it sank them all the way without complaining.  My Dewalt nicad drill was also able to do it, but it had to grunt.  The Ryobi lithium gave up with about 1\" of screw still sticking up.  maybe a battery issue, that drill is getting old now, but it just stalled out.4)  The battery charges incredibly fast.  I don't know how they did it, but it goes from empty to full in about 20 -25 minutes.  The kit i bought came with only one battery, and I ordered a spare based on experience with other drills, but really I don't think there's much need for the spare.  The drill lasts so long that by the time it needs a charge you'll be ready for lunch / dinner / or a break, and it will re-charge fully while you're eating.  In heavy use away from 120v power, I'd want two batteries to make it through the day.5)  The battery has a built-in charge indicator, so you know if it's dead.  It seems to be accurate enough, and is handy to check how much charge you have before it needs some juice.  I think this is becoming more common on drills now, but this is the first drill I've owned that had one on it.Cons1)  The case is heavily advertised as a \"feature\", almost to the point of confusion on the Amazon listing.  It is a nice case, very sturdy.  But for me it's definitely a bit overkill, and it takes up a lot of space.  I store my drills in a roll-around, and the case is as big as the one for my sawzall.  I'd prefer a thinner case that holds the drill, charger, and 2 batteries securely, but doesn't take up a cubic foot of space.  A minor complaint, and if you're hauling tools in a truck all day the case would probably be perfect for that purpose.2)  I couldn't find anywhere to store a bit on the drill.  I like to keep a #2 phillips / flathead general purpose combo bit in the drill for when something comes up that the current bit isn't suited for (like test fitting an electrical plate when shooting square-head drywall screws.)  But so far I haven't found any way to do that with this drill.  A magnetic clip or bit holder integrated into the handle would be nice.  A belt clip was included, but I don't use it.For the kit at $115, I think it's worth the money.  If you're working off-site without power, get another battery.  If you're working somewhere with power, just remember the charger and make sure to charge it when you take a break and you won't need an additional battery.I've been in the habit of bringing a corded drill for the especially difficult tasks (mixing drywall mudd or mortar, driving lag bolts, etc), and will probably continue to do that.  This drill is good and may handle those tasks just fine, but I'd rather burn up an inexpensive corded drill by abusing it than a nice lithium drill.  For all other purposes, I think this can replace a corded drill completely.",

This drill will adjust to just about any torque setting you need and on full lock it has so much power it will yank out of your hand if you aren't careful. The battery charges in 15 minutes and lasts a long time. Makita made another winner with this one. Oh, by the way, it also screws and drills superbly.",

It did the job fine, but I wanted to see if the claim that it was tough really carried any water so I climbed up to the top of my trailer and tossed it onto the ground. Not a scrach it. Then I gave it to \"the worlds stongest man\" who works at the carnival with me; still nothing. Finally I backed my '84 yugo over it and that did the trick. Now I know that most cars could easily destroy a drill, but this is a crappy yugo with only headlight (in actuality I was hoping that the drill was going to break the car not the other way around) so given that I cannot recomend this drill and also believe that they are falsely advertising the toughness of this drill. Buy a black and decker instead",

I did a lot of research and the prices for cordless drills was all over the place. It made me wonder what the main differance was between them. After looking at performance instead of price. I discovered that the Bosch DDS180 had the most in ft lbs (over 600) of torgue of anything on the market. So the fact that this Bosch came with two 18V Lithium-Ion batteries, fast charger and hard storage case sold me. This drill is awsom. It will drive screws like nothing you have ever used and the battery doesn't seem to go down. You can't go wrong buying this drill.And the best price I found on the net was at Amazon. When checking prices make sure you are comparing prices for the drill, 2 batteries, and hard case.  Jim Sanderson, Erie PA",

The light on the drill is useless because you have to pull the trigger to get the light to turn on.My only real complaint is the batteries. The batteries begin to lose power fairly quickly but they charge very fast. When using it under heavy load, the small batteries last about 20 minutes. (I was using it to drill through 1/4\" steel) With two batteries, I am usually able to rotate them between the charger and the drill since they charge faster than they die.The drill also tends to get hot under the heavy conditions, but so far I haven't had any problems.*Update: Had problems with the bit actually wobbling slightly in the chuck. (I appologize if I mix up terms) Had continued to get worse so I took it to the nearest ACE Hardware and they replaced it with a new one without any difficulties. The new one works much better, but getting the bit in straight is still a pain in the butt.",

Why lug around a beastly-size cordless drill when you don't have to?  Only rarely have I found the 9.6V drill to be lacking in torque (I mostly drill in wood with 3/8\" and smaller twist bits).  If you need something with more speed and/or torque then consider the 12V (the upper speed of the 9.6V is 1,100 rpm vs. 1,400 rpm for the 12V).Batteries recharge fast (less than 1 hour) but the ones for my newest drill seem to last only about 1/2 as long as the first batch did.  And, they are NiCad so you need to make sure you top-off the charge if you've not used the drill in the past several DAYS.  Short battery life between charges is my only complaint.  The new drill models have a chuck lock which is most handy--you no longer have to hold the chuck still when loosening or tightening the chuck.This is a great product from DeWalt and, except for the short batterly charge duration, I strongly recommend it.",

        "reviewText": "I was very pleased with its performance. The first thing I did after charging the batteries, which only took about 30 minutes each, was to drive a 3in. screw into a piece of 4x4 without pre-drilling. It did the job flawlessly with power to spare. I have a large hand so the fit & balance was perfect. Feels great in my hand. I love the fact that it came with 2 rechargeable batteries. The included flashlight works well but is made out of very cheap, thin plastic. I wasn't expecting the drill to weigh as much as it did (with battery). It weighs 4-1/2 lbs. My other B&D cordless weighs half this but doesn't perform nearly as well.UPDATE 4/18/13:I have been using this drill almost daily (2-3 hours) since purchase in my back yard building a 19' x 17' covered patio. It performs better than expected. Yesterday the battery charger started acting up. It would not charge the batteries. I finally figured out by cleaning the battery contacts on each battery with a pencil eraser did the trick, at least for the first battery. I cleaned the contacts on the second battery before placing it in the charger and the battery would not charge. This time I used a moderate amount of force when putting the battery in the charger and good results, so far. Both batteries are holding a good long charge. I was caught off guard by this development especially after only a few weeks. I purchased this drill kit brand new.UPDATE 4/22/13:I think the battery charger problem resolved itself. I had been using the drill in bright sunlight in 80+ degree weather. The drill and the battery pack were very warm. I let the battery pack cool for awhile, indoors, before charging it and all is well, so far. A fully charged battery pack lasts about 3 hours of almost continuous use. I simply love this drills performance.UPDATE 6/12/13No more problems with the battery charger. The batteries are holding a good charge from almost daily use. I couldn't be happier.",

I bought this unit along with some attachments as well.I charged it, then it was a couple of weeks before I got to my project.  My spouse put the saw blade on for me, had no problem.I had to cut down to size, 5 pieces of vinyl privacy lattice for my project.  And screw those to some frames.This unit handled the job just fine!  Changing the heads/attachments is so easy, it really made the whole job go smoothly.I had more than enough battery power for this project and haven't even recharged yet.I am nearly 60, 5ft 2, female and did this project on my own.Wish I had had this system years ago.For not big jobs, this is so handy.  Not too heavy, kinda balanced.I love cordless tools and vacuum cleaners.  It cuts out 3-4 steps just getting ready for a project.This Black and Decker system is worth every penny.If this was the only project I did with it, and it won't be, but if it were, it paid for itself already, as I did not have to hire someone to do the project, or bother my spouse who is time limited as it is!",

Lithium batteries take very long time to charge (4-6 hrs) with the wimpy charger provided and the charge doesn't seem to last that long.  I still prefer my B&D 14.4V NiCAD drill.  Grip on the 20 V drill is smaller than on my older B&D drill.  If you've got big hands, you won't like this drill.  Drill also seems to have some sort of battery level and torque level cutout that stops the drill dead in its tracks.  With the low rotation speed, bits get caught up drilling metal and the motor cuts out when the motor clearly has enough torque to clear the chip and keep going.",

And that is before you attach the impact head.It would seem that in order to make the head units interchangable they had to design some \"slop\" into a couple of areas so consumer could change them easily.You'll find the head unit will move side to side a bit when locked into the drill base.Feels bad at first, but so far has not caused any problems with driving screws straight or drilling a straight hole.Might be a problem for very precise work, but for normal use is fine.Also, they made the drive shaft coupler a bit oversized in order to be able to engage both sides quickly and easily, that shows up as a bit of slack in the drive line and you can turn the chuck back and forth a bit by hand an 1/8th inch or so.Again, this seems bad at first but also has not caused a problem in use so far.  Just creates some extra noise you don't hear with direct drive types.I do wish they (any Mfg) would not feel the need to use silver paint on plastic parts to make them look more like metal, looks fine until it wears a bit and shows the black plastic under it.  First time you drill a hole or drive a screw in a tight corner without using a bit extension you'll scrape  paint off of the chuck.  Does not bother the operation of course, but could be avoided if it were just left black plastic.  Note that the impact head IS metal and not painted plastic.This is not a high speed drill but does do a nice job of drilling 0 - 800 rpm if you lock it on the \"drill\" icon and not use the clutch settings.Note this accessory is \"impact\" attachment not \"Hammer drill\"  extra force applied is in rotational direction rather than from rear of bit.This attachment is not a full power impact wrench for automobile lug nuts etc.  This is made to help drive and remove screws in tough materials, although you CAN use some smaller sockets on it when they are not of critical torque.It also is not made to help drill into concrete like a 'Hammer' drill is.  As noted, it does not hammer from the back of the bit at all.Have to note that I did have a charging problem with mine on the third charge (bad charger), but Amazon replaced the whole kit to correct the problem, including free return shipping  (Charger had red LED flashing to indicate a problem) owners manual did not mention the red light, only flashing green for charging and solid green for full charge.",

        "reviewText": "The 120C tries to meet the needs of home improvement amateurs by integrating an \"AutoSense\" figure rather than user adjustable torque settings. I am hardly Joe Fixit, but I never had much trouble using older power drills, and have never overdriven a screw, even at my low to moderate skill level. I am therefore not quite sure who exactly needs the Autosense feature, In any case, the sensor does work well enough, on a variety of smooth surfaces, which is what I used it with. The sensor only engages in drive mode and does not activate when drilling. Selection between the two modes is done easily on a large very visible mode selection panel.I have a prior generation B&D 18 volt cordless, which is less powerful than the 120C, yet is close to twice as large. B&D has made huge strides in producing a small compact though powerful drill, and battery life is longer while charge times are also much shorter for the new 120C: less than 4 hours for max charge, and the lithium battery holds its charge for weeks if not months. (Haven't had it long enough to check max shelf life, but it's certainly at least one month.) The battery indicator is accurate, highly visible, and a very useful feature that enables the user to plan ahead, especially if one only has a single battery to use.The 120C feels sturdy and well made, with one small issue noted in my unit. Mainly, an ugly plastic seam in the middle of the upper base of the handle/ battery linkage area, centered right around the LED worklight. Though the seam did not impair functionality in any way, and did not widen during my month of use, it does not give the same impression of high quality seen in the rest of the 120C's build.Other than the cosmetic blemish, I had three other gripes: first, my last B&D drill cost less than the 120C yet came with a selection of 30 drivers and bits. As B&D seems to be targeting the 120C at amateur fixer-uppers, they could have thrown a few more drivers and drill bits into the equation. In similar poorly reasoned de-contenting, B&D also has taken out the leveler found in both of my prior cordless units. The smaller frame may be the reason, but I liked the old feature. Finally the LED light is angled oddly and seems very dim, but this is not exactly uncommon in the world of cordless tools.Pros won't be using this as a main tool, but those with amateur or moderate skill levels and home repair needs will find the 120C a useful companion. The small size and ample power for most needs are immediately apparent, and even if AutoSense is not exactly the revolutionary feature B&D claims, the sturdy build, exemplary ergonomics, and simple yet effective controls are well above the class average. The slight de-contenting from lower priced models is disappointing at this price point, but the long battery life and rapid charging are great features,",

This drill seems much more forgiving.My only worry with this drill is that as yet, I don't know how durable it's going to be and how long the \"auto sense\" functions will work. So far it's GREAT but if there's anything amiss in the near future, I'll come back and re-do this review.Thank YOU to Amazon and the Maker/Vendor for giving me the opportunity to try this out.",

I tested this B&D drill driver on a number of 1 5/8 inch screws for a wood fence and it drove them in quite well and stopped when they were flush.  I used the phillips bit attached to the bottom of the drill and I didn't have any problems with the bit jumping off the screw heads.  I used the flat bit on some larger wood screws where I had drilled a small hole and the B&D drilled them in flush also.  The flat bit jumped off the screw head sometimes, which may mean that I should have used a larger bit.  Switching the B&D over to the drill mode, I drilled some 13/32 inch holes in 2x4's and it performed quite well.  That was the largest drill bit that I could get into the 3/8's inch chuck.  The drill is a 0 to 800 rpm variable speed.The only issue that I had with this B&D drill & driver is that the forward / reverse switch is right above the trigger, and sometimes when I gripped the drill with work gloves on, my finger would bump the switch into the center (off) or into reverse.It's nice that the 20V lithium battery is also usable in my Black & Decker weedeater, the LST420.  (However the 20V battery for this drill is 1.5 amp hours and the 20V batteries for the weedeater are 2 amp hours.)",

It immediately gives you confidence in its effectiveness and longevity.  The two year limited warranty and a 30-day money back guarantee also give confidence in Black & Decker\u2019s quality in this tool.Some of the initial pros are the battery indicator along with the lithium ion battery that should not be vulnerable to being charged to death and rendering the tool useless, as happened with my prior driver.  Plus, I am glad to know when I pick it up how long I\u2019ve got with it.  Those two frustrations had inspired me to buy an electrically-powered drill, but I hope I can avoid those issues now.I\u2019m not going to pretend that I am a handyman which means the simplest tasks can become frustrating which is why I need a reliable and easy to use drill/driver.  For the basic tasks, this has performed satisfactorily and fills the need well.The trigger and reverse button makes it easy to manage the force and direction of the rotation.  The speed adjusts as you put more pressure on the trigger.  It is a fast and powerful drill for a cordless. The grip is comfortable and rubbery rather than plastic.  You can get a good grip on it.  The lights are a nice touch, too.  It comes with one changeable piece with phillips or flathead on opposite sides.  It has a place to hold this piece.  It does not come with drill pieces.  It also does not come with a case.The autosense feature seems to be hit or miss.  The drill does stop quicker than it would without that feature, but I don\u2019t think this is so much of a reason to buy this over another drill.  The reliability is the selling point for me.",

The drill senses when a screwhead is flush with the material and cuts power to the motor automatically without having to adjust any clutches. It works very well, it drove and sank several 1-2 inch screws flush into 2x4 material. Its not perfect as it did have a hard time detecting when the screw was flush on larger 3 inch screws but this was on and off. I would say in the functionality department it worked great most of the time.Its got a good amount of power for running 3 inch screws and can easily sink those 3 inch screws past the surface and drill holes up to 5/8\" inches. Has 2 modes for screwdriving with autosense and a drill mode for full speed drilling.I'm well acquainted with heavy duty professional power tools so I know a good tool when I see one. This drill is well built since its made by the same company that produces Dewalt power tools, even the handle is similar to the ones on Dewalt 20v max power tools.In case anyone is wondering, no, the batteries are not cross compatible even though they look similar. Anyways back to this black and decker drill. Its got plenty of features the pro brands have such as an LED light for lighting up dark areas. This feature comes in handy, trust me, its definitely not a gimmick. Has the latest tech with lithium-ion batteries which are long lasting and can hold a charge up to 18 months. Since we're on the topic of batteries I tested this drill out and am very impressed with the endurance. I was able to do a combined total of 113 holes drilled and screws driven. Talk about long run times.Other features include a built in bit holder, variable speed trigger, single handed plastic chuck. Whats great about the chuck is that only one hand is needed to tighten the chuck itself. On some of the older drills they had 2 piece chucks that needed a hand for each part, not with this drill.The charge time is 3-4 hours which is about average for this category of drills. Now if you're wondering why this drill deserves 5 stars out of 5 considering I'm used to pro power tools, the answer is simple. In this drills price point and category its a great performer. Sure there is better performing power tools out there but those are out of the scope of the typical \"homeowner\" or \"diy\" person and is overkill and not to mention those tools come with a price tag to match. The average person isn't going to pay 200+ for a drill and isn't going to need the high performance they offer. The average person will be pleased with the performance of this drill and might even be surprised at what its capable of and will definitely find the autosense feature handy.So do yourself a favor and check out my full review on youtube http://youtu.be/X3Gwu3dw0SMthanks guys",

I was able to use \"bits\" from my other drill/screwdriver without any issue, and it was crazy powerful, even when I had a few screws that didn't want to fit in correctly.  Very highly recommended.

It's pretty lightweight, as drills go, and not having to drag a long heavy-duty orange electrical cord all over the place is very nice.I don't have enough experience with drills to be able to give a detail-by-detail summation of everything this drill can do and how it compares to other drills on the market, but what I can say is that this one sure beats the one I had! I love being able to just pick it up and run with it. (Well, not really run, but you know what I mean.)I have heard that the Black and Decker batteries, even the rechargeable ones, don't last long, but I'm not likely to wear this one out anytime soon on drilling holes in planters and buckets, which is what I'll use it for.I like it.",

        "reviewText": "Because I only do home improvement projects on an irregular \u201cas needed\u201d or \u201cas the spirit moves me\u201d basis, one of my biggest beefs with my tools has always been battery life, battery power supply, and battery charge status. If I remember to plug in the charger and put the least charged battery on the charger the night before a project, I\u2019m okay, but often I do not think about a project until the day of, and then it becomes a \u201cbattery and charger tango\u201d between me and wherever my project is located. At last, this Black and Decker drill with lithium ion battery promises to change all that.First of all, the drill actually runs right out of the box. Just attach the battery, pull the trigger, and, rotation! I knew right away I was going to like it. I removed the battery and put it on the charger. It was fully charged in about an hour (it might have been quicker; I wasn't paying that close attention to it.) The feel of the drill is compact and solid, but because of its small size, it feels \u2013 and is \u2013 much easier to control compared to other power drills I have owned. The power is good, and the LED display, charger monitor, and light are all nice touches. The drill comes only with one two-ended driver bit, but all my old Ryobi drive bits and adapters fit, so I should be able to do plenty of hole opening and screw driving with this with no problem. Operation is smooth. I tested the auto sense feature and it seemed to work quite well. My previous drill just basically lost torque when a screw reached a certain point, so this new feature is definitely one of the highlights for me. And speaking of lights, my 50-year old eyes really appreciate the drive light.Although my use of this drill has been somewhat limited so far, it has tackled every job I've thrown at it will no difficulty or issues. I've only charged the battery once and it is still going strong. I\u2019m very happy with this tool.",

        "reviewText": "This is a sad, sad excuse for a drill.  It says multi-speed but it's a bit of a misnomer as the speed ranges from 'high speed ineffective whir' to 'sounds more throaty but still can't drive a screw'.  I bought it for what I thought was pretty casual household use: drilling pilot holes in a few pieces of wood for craft projects and then screwing said pieces of wood together... yeah, not so much.  I ended up with a bunch of partially installed screws and had to resort to a neighbour's Ryobi to get them all the way in.  Other frustrations: the chuck did not tighten perfectly so I really had to reef on it to get it to even hold the drill bit securely.  It felt overly small, light, and flimsy in hand.  I was hoping to be impressed and instead I'm irritated.  Unfortunately I left it too long to use it to return it.The lone pros that give it two instead of one stars: the battery life appears excellent.  I was able to use the drill for an extended period of time, though ineffectively.  It comes with two batteries which I imagine would come in handy if one didn't have a neighbour with a Ryobi.",

I recently decided that another portable drill would be just the thing to keep in my RV.  Raising and lowering the \u201cscissor jacks\u201d that level the unit by hand can be a chore. This is a nice tool.  Very well made, and a great fit and finish typical of Bosch. This drill is relatively light weight but more importantly well balanced. The light is a nice addition and it points where the drill/screwdriver bit is.The battery included is a 2Ah with digital fuel gauge. A nice feature. Just right for my use.  Charging took nearly 30 minutes for a nearly depleted battery. The charger is easy to use. This size battery is a good compromise between the usual 1.5Ah and bigger over priced 3 or 4 Ah units.The L-BOXX is very large.  That\u2019s disappointing for home use as if I wanted a humongous tool box I\u2019d buy one.  Unfortunately, the smaller box that, shipped with my 2 year old Bosch, has disappeared from the line.Minus 1 star for the over size carry case.  Not everyone needs a \"Tool-Trunk\" when all they want is a nice drill..",

I bought one and returned it.The problem with the one sent to me was the bits would wobble around.-If you chucked a 1/4 drill bit and stuck it spinning into a piece of wood you would get at least a 5/16 inch hole.-if you desired to drill a hole in a very specific spot on a piece of sheet metal, you'd have to punch it and loosen your grip on the body of the drill such that it wobbles round instead of the tip of the bit.It's a good example of bad quality control, if you want a drill that doesn't drill correctly, shop at Harbor Freight instead and save a hundred bucks.",

Had worked well for several years but battery would not charge at times so it was time to start looking since as I am sure you are aware that that the new batteries alone are almost the price of a new drill with new battery!I reviewed tons of models and really thought about the Makita being the one to purchase as I had used the ones my son owns and very impressed with it's power, long lasting charge and short recharge time but could not part with that much money for a ONE drill. When I checked on Amazon and found the Bosch with a solid 4.5 stars and great reviews at an unbelivable price of $129. plus free shipping as a Prime member, it was a no-brainer. It also arrived a day earlier than it was scheduled.I use the drill/driver everyday in my business and it performs great and have only had to recharge the battery once! I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants a quality product at a great price!",

The battery life is great, and the recharge time is only around 35 minutes or so.  There is a light on the base that is pointed up toward the driver, it comes on when the trigger is pulled.  It is very convenient, and made me realize how often I work in areas where the light conditions are poor.  I have yet to come across a situation where I do not have enough torque out of this driver.I would definitely buy this again and recommend it to friends.",

I picked it over a similar DeWalt model primarily for the numerous uniformly high ratings given to the Bosch DDB 180-02 version, despite there being relatively few reviews for this specific model, and for the price.  So far, I've used it for a few small home improvement projects.  It came fully charged, is light, has a lot of power when you want it (helped along by the 18-position adjustable clutch and variable speed switch), fits well in my hand, and can be held steadily without too much difficulty while you're drilling.  The battery is also easy to pop in and out (it comes with only one battery, but that works fine for me). At least so far, I can't think of anything negative to say about it.  The carrying case is clunky and somewhat overblown in Bosch's advertising, but the drill and battery fit well within it and there is room for drill bits and other small accessories.  One thing that's important is to make sure you get quality drill bits to go along with it.  Personally, I bought a set of DeWalt titanium bits at Home Depot.",

Everything about this drill is great, the batteries, charger, smooth operation, easy to add/remove drill bits, etc...etc...  I also have the job site radio to use the batteries in as well.

You need a cross between the slow and wimpy electric screwdrivers, and a full size drill.  This is that cross.  It is great for hanging devices, assembling a rack, drilling 3/8\" alarm contacts, installing wall plates, speakers, you name it.As long as you keep in mind that this drill IS NOT meant as a replacement for a full size 18V drill, you will be happy with it!  I keep my Makita 18V Hammer drill in the truck for the big jobs, such as pre-wiring wear lots of holes need to drilled in studs, etc.  But I use this little guy most of the time.  It's light enough to keep on your belt without weighing you down, and it lasts a good while on a charge.  (I know that isn't a quantifiable statement, but everyone's results will vary depending on use).  I typically get a weeks work out of a charge, and with two batteries, you only have to charge twice a month!  Not bad.  (Don't expect to drill tons of 1\" holes in studs with this, that's not what it was made for!)The build quality is great.  The chuck is perfectly centered, no wobble on my unit like the other reviewer mentioned.  Case is solid, I've dropped mine on concrete a couple of times, and no issues.  The keyless chuck holds as well as any keyless chuck does.  It can really put out some good torque in 1st gear if needed.  2nd gear doesn't have tons of torque, but is good enough to drill alarm contacts, and spins fast which is great for mounting speakers and wall plates.Overall, I'm VERY pleased with this purchase.  When I bought it, I paid $50.00 more, and it's worth it.  It's a great deal at the current price.  I've had mine nearly two years now, no problems.",

Fits well in tight places, and except for one thing I wouldn't hesitate to go out and buy a second. Now a days it is common for manufacturers to have a \"safety\" feature of a chuck brake.  When you release the trigger a brake is engaged that abrubtly stops the chuck causing (at high speed)the chuck to open and release the bit, which usually drops to the floor.  Very frustrating, you seem to be constantly picking up bits off the floor.  I have tried releasing the trigger slowly, so as to engage the brake softly, this works sometimes.",

If you have the need for a drill and impact driver I suggest getting the set to save you a couple bucks.  If you need just a lithium ion 3/8 Drill/ Driver this is a great pick.  Compact and very powerful.  This is a solid tool.On a side note.  One thing all people buying lithium ion tools need to know.  Currently, there is no such thing as a 12v Lithium Ion battery.  You can not make a 12v battery using the battery cells which are mass produced today.  Thats why these tools have the 12v \"MAX\" description.  Makita and Bosch were honest in their marketing when they first introduced their compact tools as 10.8v which is the most accurate and considered the continuous charge.  12v is the charge held by the 10.8v battery when it comes off the charger fully charged.  Other tool companies then began labeling their tools with this max charge, creating the 12v \"MAX\".  Makita and Bosch had to relabel their tools once they began to lose American market share since us Americans are obsessed with numbers.  If you did not know better, and saw a 10.8v and a 12v MAX side by side for $100 each, you probably would get the 12v MAX thinking you are getting more for your money, when in fact they are the exact same thing.  Same holds true for 20v MAX, its really an 18v battery.",

You can easily fit this in a tool pouch or simply stick it in a pocket for easy access. There is plenty of power for those quick jobs where you need a drill but don't want to use a screwdriver. I am surprised that I can use this more and more once you find out the power it has and what the tool can do. The LED light is always handy, its nice that Makita makes their light stay on for a few seconds after you release the trigger. Other brands I have tried you have to barely pull the trigger to allow the light to come on if you lose the screw or fastener in the dark.Two thumbs up for this 12V drill.PS. The 12V impact goes great with this drill.",

Love & use ALL the attachments I own which is just about them ALL. Retired but still do alot of work at home and out and about. Have 8 batteries cause you need them but I also have a 20v weed eater and other tools so it works well.

The 18-volts provide plenty of power for several hours of intermittent use... perfect for my needs.  I haven't had any problem with the keyless chuck but then I've only been using it for a month or so.  What I AM disappointed about - and it's my own fault for not paying attention - is that the batteries are Ni-Cad, not lithium.  This means you have to COMPLETELY deplete each battery before recharging, because the ni-cads have a memory.  You might do better to look for the same tool but with a lithium power source.",

So great being free of the cord of my Dremel tool yet having the full power that the battery Dremels lack to the point of uselessness. I mainly use 1.25\" reinforced cut off wheels to chop off hose and pex clamps, and other metal parts too small for a 3\" air cut-off saw, and this tool is ideal for it, and compact enough to not be awkward for precise work. Only concern is it gets pretty hot during use and the vents are a bit blocked where my hand wants to be, so I give it cooling rests often, hope it lasts cause I love it, time will tell. Cheers.",

I bought a corded Dremel but it just wasn't convenient, was loud and awkward in certain situations. I am not a super-heavy user, but a moderate do-it-yourselfer, with various applications for a grinder. One of my uses is dog nail trimming, and the corded Dremel really scared the dogs!After researching alternatives on Amazon, I found the Hitachi had rave reviews, and despite the higher price (after all it is a 12V lithium ion battery WITH a 2-yr battery warranty) I purchased. Love, love, love it! From using to grind dog toe nails, to grinding and cutting metal, this thing is perfect for my needs. The battery is larger, but not awkward or heavy. It is quieter than the corded Dremel. And the light? Wow! I didn't know what I was missing without a light! And this thing really holds a charge, even with sustained high speed use.All I know, is I am impressed by this device and when my Ryobi 18V Lithium ion cordless outfit (drill, saws, etc) dies this time, I am going to explore Hitachi as a replacement.",

The 20v power is enough to tackle anything I have encountered around the house.I have already used it on a few projects such as installing a french door and building a deck onto my jon boat.  The controls are right where they should be, the balance is great, and chuck is easy to swap out.  I'm very pleased with this overall.Some notes on using Lithium Ion instead of Nickel Cadmium - These batteries are great at keeping a charge when sitting unused for a long period of time.  They don't \"leak\" their charge the way that NiCad batteries do.  However, the trick with these types of batteries is to avoid draining them below 30% of their charge.  Swap them out frequently and keep them at full capacity before storing them away.For this reason, I wouldn't recommend this as a tool for any full time construction work or daily/all-day use.",

I certainly didn't need anything too fancy, but I wanted it to have enough power so that I wouldn't have to buy another down the road. I've never heard of Genesis, but I trusted the reviews and I'm glad I did.The drill is easy to operate with clear instructions for a newbie like me on how to use the chuck and what the different options mean. The battery charges fast and is easy to remove and plug into the charging cord. Sure the drill bits it came with aren't top of the line, but they work fine for me and it was better than having to buy them separately.

        "reviewText": "Right now I am living in a pretty nice little two bedroom mobile home type trailer up here in the North Dakota oil patch. One thing I really miss about being away from home besides my wife are my tools. A guy still has to fix things, and it was driving me nuts that I was not able to do something as simple as installing coat hooks to hang up my Fire Retardant bibs and parka.Long story short, I was looking for an inexpensive corded drill driver as I honestly did not want to spend more than $50. I found more than a few drill motors, but nothing that would work as a driver or screw gun with a clutch. Then I stumbled on this little jewel. It was more than I wanted to spend, but I am darn glad I pulled the trigger and bought this little DeWalt drill driver.The drill is about half the size of its big brother 18 volt I have at home. This little gem comes with a small canvas bag that easily accommodates the small quick charge unit, the two included batteries, the drill itself and there is enough room to fit the DEWALT DW2530 35 Piece Magnetic Compact Rapid Load Set found here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005S9VJP8The drill itself is very lite in your hand and very well balanced. The built in LED lights are also very nice for working in low light or poorly lit situations. The light focus right where you need it, on the work at hand. The construction is rock solid, the unit feels substantial in your hand, extremely solid and has a well built feel to it. Built like a tank but feels lite as a feather in your hands.The motor itself has allot of torque, this drill is no wimp. The clutch works smoothly and is adjustable like all DeWalt drill drivers. It has two speeds depending on the work at hand. The chuck is solid, and easily secures the quick change bit that came in the\u00a0DEWALT DW2530 35 Piece Magnetic Compact Rapid Load Set.Who is this little beauty for? I would honestly buy this for my mother, she would love this! It is the perfect size for small hands and is easily operated, lite weight and near perfectly balanced in your hand while in operation. Whoever designed this little driver deserves an award for the thought and engineering that went into this unit. It is powerful enough to handle most any task one would need a drill driver for around the house. The quick charge unit has the batteries ready in around 15 minutes and the charge lasts quite awhile. The LED light is a bonus, as is the small carry sack and extra battery. I could also see a contractor using this as was mentioned in another review, this is not a toy.If you are a homeowner and in need of a drill driver to use around the house, this is the drill driver that I would give allot of consideration to in regards to purchasing. Also, you will need drills and bits, the\u00a0DEWALT DW2530 35 Piece Magnetic Compact Rapid Load Set\u00a0is a well thought out little kit. I would recommend purchasing both for around the house, most everything you would need for fixing a door to hanging a picture can be found in the DW2530 kit, and it all fits nicely in the supplied canvas bag you get with the Dewalt DCD710S2 12 volt drill driver.",

Had to hang a plastic section of pegboard on wall board/studs and the control on the trigger was superb so I didn't have to worry about over-revving and breaking the plastic. Then proceeded to put together a new work bench and the little light came in handy working in one dark corner. I like the weight and the balance of the tool.Lots to like here--trigger control, weight, two ion-rechargeable batteries, an easy-to-use and very quick charger, and instructions written by a literate individual. Oh, and to all this add a neat little zippered bag to hold everything!",

It is small, light and has plenty of power.The LED light is an unexpected bonus. It can be turned on with a slight squeeze on the trigger, so it's possible to get right on target in a dim light situation before starting the drill.I've been using Lithium Polymer and Lithium Ion batteries in R/C planes and various computing applications for some time now.  For those who have suffered enough with the problems of NiCd and NMh batteries, this is a step into your future.Mine came from Rockler, and it was such a big hit with both my son and me, I bought him one from Amazon for Christmas.  I'm thoroughly satisfied with this product, and would consider a larger DeWalt when it's time to replace my big Makita.",

It has a high speed setting and long lasting battery that make drilling in 1/8\" metal security doors a snap.  The low speed setting is perfect for installing 3\" drywall type screws.  One warning, when the battery is done it quits without much warning.  Also, these newer \"slip-on\" batteries cannot be charged in drop-in vehicular chargers.  All things considered, the drill is an excellent light duty tool.",

        "reviewText": "This is a good drill/driver, with one exception. The LED light is placed above the trigger, and the chuck blocks the light from reaching the area where you are driving or drilling. I have seen a similar tool where the LED is placed below the grip, so it shines up onto the area where you are working. My question is, why would you want to light up only an area where you are NOT drilling or driving? I'm an engineer, and this would provide a very negative personnel review for me if I had made such a big flub. I would have given this kit five stars if the LED provided light on the work area.I purchased what appears to be an identical set, with the two batteries, one charger, and the very nice and heavy carrying bag at home depot for $99.99. I purchased it during the holidays, so it may have been on sale. I would check there before buying. You could check on-line...Also, I would like to have padded covers for the spare battery and the charger, so all the items don't hit and rub against each other when the kit is being transported. I'm going to check on Amazon to see if there are soft battery cases that might be the right size. Amazon has great prices on these cases... Soft cases with hook-and-loop closures would be very handy. Another alternative would be to have padded partitions built into the bag, to separate the items. Of course, either option would definitely increase the cost of the kit, which would be a downer. i.e., much of the reason I purchased mine is that it is a great brand name, and the price was good.The salesmen at Home Depot recommended Dewalt over similarly priced kits, because they believe it is a very reliable tool.Again, the carrying bag is excellent.FYI, my last driver was a Makita, which provided many years of service, and I worked it very hard. For example, one job I did was a 16' x 24' deck, topped with quarter inch spaced two by fours, and I doubled screwed the two by fours down every two feet. I ran the tool continuously, charging batteries while working... A Makita would have been my other choice. I don't know if the Makita brand has maintained the same quality as my Makita drill had, but it they are close, the Makita is still a great choice. If I had not seen this Dewalt at a good price, and done a spur-of-the-moment purchase, I would have purchased a Makita. I don't know if the Makita's have a optimally placed LED - a good thing to check on any drill/driver.",

A spare battery runs $60-$80 and the light - well, that's just a throwaway. So the question is, \"Do I spend the $60-$80 to replace the battery or do I spend $100-$150 to buy a different power drill?\" I'm not sure at this point. I'm expecting the battery that is working will die soon too which means it's really $120-$160 to replace both batteries in two years. I'd rather just buy a new Dewalt or something else and take my chances. There. I just talked myself into buying a different drill.",

Performance is exceptional, and the warranty is superior, although it is questionable if you will ever need it. Nothing, particularly hand tools, are indestructible.

The carrying/storage case is definitely on the flimsy side. But for the price point, warranty and performance, this tool is an outstanding value.[...]",

If I have any bias, it is that I happen to think the DeWalt brand tends to offer superior products.  However, the description fails to mention (purposely, I think) that the batteries are of the nickel-cadmium (Ni-Cd) variety.  This is a pretty important piece of information as NiMH and (more expensive) Li-Ion batteries typically offer much better performance than Ni-Cd.  My own experience with Ni-Cd batteries has taught me to never get any product that uses them, but your results may vary.",

Also when you tighten the drill bits you hear an audible clip when it's secure.  My suggestion is that before you buy it, check it out.

It's got more than enough power to handle most any typical household task, and it seems to run forever on a charge. The batteries (it comes with two) fit right into the grip instead of clipping to the bottom of it, which keeps the whole thing nice and small. I've used it mostly for screwdriving, but I've drilled a few holes too. Buy yourself a nice set of bits for a few bucks and you're good to go. I don't know how I did without it or why I waited so long!",

        "reviewText": "On arrival, this unit had a metallic clacking noise when you let off the trigger.  Especially obvious when using gear #2.  Sounds like the drill is being force-ably stopped by mechanical means, rather than coasting to a stop.  I called Porter Cable and was told this was normal.  I hung up the phone, put a bit (#36) into the chuck, tightened it, and ran the drill a few times without drilling anything.  The bit kept coming loose loose when I let off the trigger!  I re-inserted the bit, and tightened the chuck as hard as I could.  I spun the drill some more.  On/off, on/off, on/off.  And the bit came loose again!  I don't know if the chuck is the culprit, or the drill.  Seems to me that the sudden stopping of the motor is is loosening the chuck.  Corded drills don't stop like this.  They coast to a stop when power is interrupted.  Our full sized Makita cordless drill makes a little noise when you let off the trigger, but nothing like this.  I suppose this is a consequence of using a very powerful, permanent magnet motor, with an armature of very little mass.  The armature stops almost instantly, the moment it is aligned to the magnet poles.  That shocks the chuck, and the chuck loosens up.  This drill should probably have a keyed chuck.I'm going to email the manufacturer, but I don't think it will do me any good.",

The shelving was always a little less rigid that I'd have liked no matter how I tried to tighten the bolts. A few minutes with the impact driver, and the shelving is now rock solid. I did break off a few bolt heads, but that was more my fault than the tool's. I also bought the trim saw attachment to use with it, and that works great too. I'm going to get the jig saw and recip saw attachments too when I can afford them. One other benefit is that I already own a B&D leaf blower and a quick charger that uses the same batteries, so now I've got another battery to use in either tool.",

If you want a drill and impact driver that is tough as Hell then go with Bosch's Brute Tough drill and impact driver kit, it will cost you about $300.00 but it will out perform most drills on the market. Now, it would be wise to also purchase a flash battery charger and extra batteries for the Black and Decker. The charger that comes with the Black and Decker kit is just a little dinky cord that you slide on to the 20v battery and then you plug it in to an outlet, nothing more but 3 hours later you will have a fully charged 20v Black and Decker battery. If the Black and Decker had a stronger motor and the battery did not require a flash charger then this would be a decent kit. The Matrix design is really an excellent idea but there is just not enough power for the impact driver attachment.",

        "reviewText": "I'll preface by saying I have quite a lot invested in Makita's LXT system already. I love the Makita tools.Now, for the Bosch. First impression, I was impressed. This is a nice tool. Very well made, great fit and finish typical of Bosch. This drill is relatively light weight but more importantly well balanced. The controls are easy to get to and use, to include the speed selector, forward/reverse selector, and clutch. The chuck is Rohm, which is a quality brand from Germany (hopefully it actually is made there too). The outer sleeve looks like it wobbles, but the chuck itself doesn't. Very little run out, and this is a hand drill anyway. The light actually isn't too bad, it points where the drill/screwdriver bit is. All these drills cast a shadow on their lights so I can't be too negative here.The battery included is a 2Ah with digital fuel gauge. A REALLY nice feature that I wish Makita had incorporated in their batteries. Charging took nearly 30 minutes for a nearly depleted battery, not too bad. The charger is easy to use but doesn't have a fan built in like the Makita units. I wish it did as it would help cool the battery pack. This size battery is a good compromise between the usual 1.5Ah and bigger 3 or 4 Ah units.The included screwdriver bits are good quality, my kit came with a two sided bit as well as a bit holder with Philips bit. Bosch lists the drill as having 600 in/lbs of torque which translates to 50 ft/lbs. That's pretty darn good. I drilled through 3/8\" mild steel with a standard HSS 1/4\" bit and didn't have a problem. Drilled through wood and both hard and soft and no problem. I did have a bit of a hard time driving a 2\" drywall screw all the way into a 2x4 without a pilot hole. I use impacts almost exclusively now for driving screws anyway.The L-BOXX is, as others said, HUGE. I was surprised by the size quite frankly. However, it provides plenty of storage space inside which I know will be utilized. This is a knock off of the Festool Systainer system. Probably not as good as the original, but cheaper.The drill is made in Mexico, battery in Malaysia, and the L-BOXX in Germany. All in all I am impressed, happy, and highly recommend this kit!",

The light is really good also.I have used it so far for light to medium tasks, and so far it has plenty of power. The forward and backwards button is in just the right place, the chuck is real nice, I have not had it loosen up during use yet. This kit comes with the 2.0aH batt which is just the right size. Now if I can find another battery to have as a backup, for a good price, I will be 1000 percent happy with my new drill.I went back and forth between Dewalt and Mikita for a couple months. I finally decided on the Bosch as all the reviews were positive, and I heard the gearing is metal and not plastic. So this should be a longer lasting tool?",

But that's a good thing because as the years go by, you collect more and more drill bits, screwdriver tips, etc. I personally have plenty of stuff to fit in here.Also, it holds 3 battery packs. So if you use your drill a lot, you can get a good deal on a pair of large capacity Bosch batteries, and they'll fit right in the case.I didn't time the charger, but as a hobbyist the battery only needs to be fast enough to be ready when I am, which it does.The cases are stackable, which is very convenient if you want more storage that is easily accessible. And the release clips are simply brilliant. Very easy to use, very fast, and yet holds the cases together very securely.",

The bit is always dropping out during operation.2)  The chuck is real smooth therefore hard to grip, not that it makes much difference.3)  During the chuck tightening there is no gradual tightening telling you that you are getting tighter and about to reach max tightening. There is pretty much dead stop tight and instant loosening.4)  I have even tried using channel locks to torque the thing down but it make no difference.  It just does not cinch real tight.Hitachi makes a nice drill otherwise.  I wish they would use a better chuck.  I am done with them until they fix this huge problem.",

I've thrown away three of them because of the cost of replacement batteries (batteries cost more than the drills). This is a nice, compact, variable speed (high and low ranges) drill and with the lithuim batteries, it'll be ready when I am (holds charge for 18 months). Lithuim is the only way to go. Incidently, the first electric drill I ever bought was a 1/4\" Black & Decker (1963) and I still have it.",

Considering I have a total investment of $100, I could buy 3 of the big name (DeWalt, Makita etc.)drills. The only reason I did not rate it a 5 star is due to the fact I haven't put it through an extended heavy duty test to date. I have previously used DeWalt and Makita in the maintenance field and highly recommend the B&D drill if the money is coming out of your own pocket. I can't speak for the other manufacturers current products, but the B&D easily stands up to competitors  previous  models. The problem with the older cordless drills is battery life and relacement cost....at $60-$65 for each replacement battery, (and you need 2) I was better off going with a new drill.  What I don't know at this point is durability over the long haul....time will tell.",

My other model has a stand alone charger thus I can be charging a battery whilst using a battery in the gun.  This item charges while in the gun with a cord that plugs into the back of the gun.  Thus you cannot charge a battery whilst using a battery.  Fortunately for me, my old gun is good, the stand alone charger went bad.  So I can use the old one while my new one charges a battery.  And with two guns and two charged batteries, my six year old can help me in my projects! Likely gonna have to get another one soon - my three year old is moving in quick!",

The LED work light is utterly pointless as it does not illuminate the actual work area. (Admittedly several other inexpensive drills have the same problem.) Feels top-heavy in the hand; the one I bought charges much slower than advertised and appears to discharge too rapidly. Overheats after a short work stint, although not critically. You could certainly do worse, but I would advise you either to step up in price and buy a real high-quality drill-driver from DeWalt, Bosch or Makita -- or go to the Sears site and buy the Craftsman C3, which is the same price (or a smidgen cheaper) and in my experience a lot better.",

        "reviewText": "Make sure you get the SKIL Model number 1464-02 or later. The earlier ones had issues. After looking at the specs of various candidate models, I purchased this little sucker at Wally*World this morning so I could finish a job today after my big 18V Cummins Ni-Cad charger fried itself yesterday.  The Cummins drill is now useless, along with some other tools that use the same battery. Lithium is the only way to go from now on.  My cell phone is lithium and even my little shirt pocket Mutant WiFi radio is lithium. The user's manual says the lithium battery gets progressively stronger with the first five charges, and my unit, though only partially charged out of the box, was up to full power in less than an hour.A red LED alerts you when the power's getting low. The red LED blinks during charging. When the battery is full the light shuts off and the charger automatically stops charging. Can't be simpler. There's a bar lever on top allowing you to shift gears and select high speed for drilling or low speed for turning screws at high torque. The comparable Black & Decker model didn't have this feature, plus it was huge compared to this little powerhouse. If the SKIL holds up it will be fine for my occasional household needs.Lithium batteries don't have memories like Ni-Cad's, can be topped off frequently without harming them, and when not in use hold their charge for an incredibly long time. We're talking a year or more. The battery isn't replaceable, so if it ever wears out I'll just toss the whole unit and get another one.A good workman will select the proper tool for the job. If you're in the construction business and need a drill that sees heavy daily use and requires a lot of high-speed torque, and will accept larger bit (over 1/4 -inch) you should buy a big industrial drill for a gazillion dollars. But for the average home handyman who has a lot of honeydews (\"honey do this,\" and \"honey do that\") this SKIL will do a great job.It fits the hand nicely, the controls are where they belong, and it has a nice padded no-slip feel.My only two gripes are minor ones:1) In their zeal to come up with a compact, well thought out ergonomic design, the engineers forgot to include an onboard snap-in holder for the Phillips/slotted screwdriver bit (furnished) so it doesn't get lost. Most of the other drills have a built-in holder somewhere, sometimes two.2) The tightening collar section of the chuck next to the drill body is very narrow, making it difficult to grasp when tightening the forward section to hold the bit tight enough to prevent bit slippage.I was tempted to dock this drill one star for these minor gripes, but decided to let it slide because the rest is so good.Will update later if there's a reason.",

        "reviewText": "I have had this drill for over a year.  It is still holding its original charge despite being used for all the small chores that need a drill around the house.  I am very pleased with it.I am attaching a collage of 3 numbered photos under customer photos that I will be referencing in this review.I LIKE:-------1. This drill is light, easy to hold, and easy to work with even in awkward places. Photo#1 shows this drill on a postal scale, and you can see that it weights 1 pound 7.1 oz.This is the main reason I bought the drill (due to back surgery it was painful for me to hold the bigger heavier Black&Decker drill I have) and it totally lived up to my expectations.2. The shape of the drill is very compact and ergonomically comfortable.  Photo #2 shows me holding the drill. I wear gloves size small for size, so my hands are pretty small.3. This drill has an excellent battery. It has Lithum-Ion battery that holds a charge for up to 18 months. I have had it well over a year, used it for a number of small projects. I used it again this weekend and it still works.4. I recharged it this weekend and I liked that it has an indicator when it is fully charged.  My old drill just has an indicator that it is charging, and never tells me when it is done. (The drill charger is included in the set)5. This drill has a nice number of clutch settings, and lets me set driving power perfect for a specific task.6. The drill has has 2 speeds7. I like having forward and reverse indicators to be sure I have the right setting8. It comes with a nice canvas carrying case 9.7 x 7.8 x 2.8 inches, which I show closed in in photo #3, and opened in the background of photo #2.  The case has Velcro to hold the drill and the charger.  It also has a mesh pocket on the cover to hold the bits.I DON'T LIKE:-------------1. This drill cannot handle a 3/8 chuck for 1/2 inch drill.  In a couple of my projects I needed a bigger chuck and had to go back to the big old drill.  I know, they probably could not keep it this small if it needed to handle 3/8 inch chuck but I did not realize this restriction when I bought the drill.2.  Updated: \"Don't like\" removed! Originally I thought the drill did not have a neutral position only forward/reverse, and I have been leaving it in engaged position when it was not in use feeling somewhat uncomfortable about that. However, thanks to a follow-up comments from James (thank you!) I have been able to find the neutral off position.  The forward/reverse slider has a detent in the middle where the trigger is locked. If you push the forward/reverse switch through gently and slowly, you'll feel where it wants to stop in the middle of the slider.Overall, I am very pleased with this drill and recommend it.Ali Julia review",

It's sturdy and has plenty of power. Lacks on-board bit storage, but then that's a problem for every drill that's out there. I like the fact that the charger's built into the handle, not separate. I bought this for the (standalone) workshop but may just keep it in the house, where I need a compact light-duty drill that won't bleed its charge like NiCads do.",

Good build quality, feels solid, the chuck wobbles just a little, but hasn't bothered me yet. The two speed gear box and torque settings make this thing perfect for almost any job. Li-ion batteries, for under 50 bucks, that's right, ni-cads are so 1990. It's not going to go all day on the job, but that's not what it's for. Compromising battery life for weight and size is always hard, and they did a good job. A lot of the other small drivers are only 3 or 4 volts which would suck, this gives you 7.2, enough that I was drilling through aluminum the other day. Everyone should have one, and for the price you shouldn't even question if you need it. Just get it and you will find yourself using it for everything.",

        "reviewText": "I needed to buy a drill for my son who lives across the country.  I ordered this one as a great compromise between an 18v drill (too heavy to hold) and a 9.6 and below drill which would not finish the job.  After he got it, he charged it up and we flew in to help him set up his apartment.  Hours later after much Ikea furniture assembly, the drill was going strong.I specifically like the just right weight between the heavier drills (I have a few of those!)  and the flashlight type of drills.  This one will last most of the day as long as you are not drilling multiple 2\" screws into wood.  It is perfect for assembly and the charge lasts.  I also like the torque adjuster which is has pictures and is simple to adjust.  The charger is a small plug in wall wart type and it plugs into the back of the drill.I have somehow collected a number of drills - Makita, Bosch, and others.  This one does the job and is the perfect balance between the heavier 18v drills with enough juice to make it though most jobs.",

Certainly not intended for heavy use - this is not an impact drill, but, if you have good quality bits for the specific job (Dewault, etc.) then you can get by with this for home use. No issues going through masonry with the aforementioned bits. Be patient, keep a full charge, and you should get many years of light to medium duty service out of this drill. I have gone through masonry and pt lumber with a paddle bit, so this little drill will hold up to home use, as long as you respect its limitations. Be carefull if you use it as a driver, back off the recommended torque at least one setting, to protect your clutch in the chuck from binding up, just a thought as I bound up my prior drill that way.",

We are a small electrical contractor with only me and my two sons doing about 75 homes a year for 4 builders and hope these hold up better than all the other drills we have been buying on sale and seem to last only about 6 months. These are the first lithium drills we have purchased. Have always went for the sale items in the big box stores and have been very disappointed at the results of them.

        "reviewText": "I don't usually write reviews. However, I felt compelled to write my feelings on the Dewalt DCD780 cordless drill.  I've always thought of Dewalt as one of the main players in the drill market. Thus, I own two DC727s. I use them mainly as drivers for drywall screws, and if no other choice for drilling. They're slow, and don't possess a whole lot of torque; however they've been reliable. Although I never understood Dewalts insistence on NiCad battery technology, I have a few NiCads that continue to barely creep along. I upgraded to 3.0Ah NiMh batteries, (not dewalt) which really helped, the DC727s still lacked the power I needed for real drilling. Consequently I own 250' of extension cord to use my corded drills when I really needed to get out and drill something.  In walks the DCD780. I just recieved this drill today so this will be a 1st date review. I'd upgraded to Li-Ion batteries for my other devices, I guess I felt like I was still waiting/wanting for that technology in a drill. Most of us have probably had the experience of needing to drill something only to grab the cordless and the pack is dead, **! So, we go to the corded and 250' of extension cord. I've never grabbed my Li-ion flashlight to find dead batteries. The NiMh are more tollerant of abuse, and I can charge them anywhere in their cycle without worrying about memory effect. I've got some Eneloop NiMhs that hold their charge pretty well. My Li-ions hold their charge very well; I'm just careful not to draw them down too low. The Dewalt touts the DCD780 as having technology to prevent overdrawing from the Li-ion pack, (which from what I've read is not good for a Li-ion battery).  Upon opening the package, the 3.0Ah battery still had enough juice, from whenever it'd been charged, to spin the drill quite impressively. In fact, while I put one pack on the charger, I took the drill out to the garage with the other 3.0Ah pack. Holly crap, this is what I've been waiting for. It's actually smaller than my DC727s, but much, much more powerful. It's like having a corded drill in my hands! With a driver bit intalled, I drove a 3\" deck screw sideways through a 2x4\" until it became too hot to handle. I let it cool and repeated until I was bored and tired. Wow, this is the cordless drill I've been waiting for! No more trying to rodeo an extension cord while on a 20' ladder. Next I threw in a 2\" forstner bit and dove in to the 2x4....cool! I can see this is going to be fun!  Anyway like I said, this is a first date thing. I'll use this drill hard, (I've got a house remodel in front of me) if it pukes I'll let you know. It's rare I'm really impressed with a new tool, but this is an exception. The Dewalt DCD780 is small, powerful, cool LED light that stays on after slightly pulling on the trigger. Reliability is what I also look for. So, we'll see. However, if the drill continues to perform like it did out of the box, then I'll continue to be \"Wowed\". This is the cordless drill I've been waiting for. Good job Dewalt!",

The one problem that I have is the drill box is so compact, you have no room to place drill bits or common & phillip head screw drivers. Instead of having to carry my drill and a case of drill bits, I ended up removing my old Dewalt 18v drill from its carrier and placed the new drill & hardware in the larger case. Not only does everything fit snug but I was able to put a small pouch of drill & screwdriver bits inside. I also noticed that with the older Dewalt drills you could tighten & loosen a bit by just runnig the drill and you would lock the bit in place or remove a bit. I found that when I do this with the new drill,the bit becomes loose after a while. All you need to do is hand tighten the bit in place and it works fine. I had to either replace my 18v batteries or purchase the compact Dewalt DCD780C2. When I felt this new drill in my hand and the power it puts out, I knew I made the right choice.",

        "reviewText": "I loved almost every aspect about this drill (DCD780C2), but I ended up returning it.I got fed up with the ever decreasing battery life of my ancient but solid Makita.  Both batteries exhausted doing 20 1/8\" drill hits through 1/8\" angle aluminum.  Not much more $$ to buy a new drill than replace batteries, so that's what I tried.  This Dewalt is a stellar drill in most respects.  It did 3x the workload of the Makita, in less time, and apparently using only a fraction of the charge in the battery.  The combination of high power, small size and weight, and excellent ergonomics in the hand is a huge benefit that I didn't fully appreciate until I used the drill for myself.  I am now certain that for my usage, a compact form factor 18V Lithium drill is the way to go.I only have one real complaint with this drill, and it's a show stopper.  Bits do not run true.  At 4\" past the chuck, a rotating bit will show over 1/8\" of wobble.  My Makita shows < 1/64\", and it has been dropped repeatedly and otherwise abused over the years.  I had some challenge with the new DeWalt walking bits on the aluminum I was working with -- a problem that was not happening with the Makita on the same material and with the same drill bit.  For someone who doesn't need precision, this drill would still be a good choice.  Which concerns me.  If the bulk of users don't need low run-out, there may be less incentive for DeWalt to fix this problem.  Still, DeWalt should know that increased run-out causes greater wear on other parts, like the bearings.So I went out to find another 18V compact that I could life with.  No go with the Hitachi DS18DSAL.  I tried two in succession and both came with dead batteries that would not charge.  Makita is rife with complaints on chuck wobble, Milwaukee has too many 18V lithium battery complaints for my taste, and Bosch has several complaints about the transmission speed switch breaking.  It seems all of these manufacturers can put out a decent drill, but marry 18V lithium to a compact form factor, and no one seems to be able to do it with high quality.In contrast, it looks like there are quality options in 12V Lithium drills.  However, I want the greater runtime, power, and presumably higher quality afforded by a beefier 18V unit.  For now, it looks like that drill may not exist.  So I'll either buy a new battery for my aging Makita, or go out and get a $60-$80 cordless that I won't mind too much if it breaks in a year.",

One thing I do like is that the battery holds charge for a long time between uses.One thing I wish is that the included light could be turned on before activating the drill.  The light is perfect for making sure the drill bit is put in the right location.  Unfortunately, the light comes on once you start the drill and that's too late to find the bit is in the wrong place.",

        "reviewText": "I bought a similar kit 5 years ago, it came with the flashlight, drill, batteries, charger and a impact driver.  At that time lithium ion batteries were fairly new and I paid $225 on sale for that kit.  I use at least one of the tools every day and at times have gone through several batteries in a day due to amount of use on projects.  I've used the drill for mixing drywall compound, paint, drilling through masonry blocks and even some concrete for tapcons.  The impact driver I've used for fences, decks and other projects without a problem.  The reason I bought this kit was for the additional batteries and charger; the extra drill and light were an added bonus.  All the original batteries are still working but I have noticed a slightly degradation in how long they last compared with the new batteries.  My only comlaint with the drill is the chuck is kind of cheap (mostly plastic) and broke, but that's partially my fault because I dropped it and now the collar does not lock in place.  As that was not a fault of the drill though and I've used it what Id consider to be pretty hard I have to give it a 5 star rating.",

Although its not my livelihood its still important to me to have a good drill. some of the dewalts and mikitas were tempting but I kept coming back to this one i like the look of it and the price. So I decided to purchase it, when I received it I was surprised at the quality metal chuck quality construction. Im here to tell you this thing is a work horse I have had it over 2 years over 30 projects later and its like brand new. The only other drill I have to compare it to is the milluakee 18v lith ion, as my work has several. To me there is no comparison. The millwuakee is much more pricey but still the quality is about the same and what I favor is the size/weight of the hitachi its so comfy in your hand and the compact design is awsome as far as usability. Bottom line get this drill you will love just as I love it. Good day fellow DIYers",

This Bosch drill is one of those rare examples where it's so good, so well thought out, operates so perfectly you just smile and go \"wow!\".I've owned Bosch tools for years and have never been disappointed, but this one really goes above and beyond anything they have come up with yet.- It's sent fully charged (a very nice courtesy)- Ergonomically it's just great - perfectly balanced especially compared with the other competing products. Very, very easy on the wrist and arm.- Very powerful but has a variable torque setting so you can use it for delicate work or breaking rusty bolts/nuts or drilling through rocks- Very quiet and what little noise it makes is quite pleasant- The case is very well designed and a great value add with ample storage for bits, stud finders, pencils, etc- IT HAS A FLASHLIGHT built into the handle so that you can clearly see what you are doing!!!- Has a torque cut out so you can't strip screw-heads, but it works beautifully so you can still drive them into tough materials without any problem. I don't know how they did it, but they did.- Batteries are a solid fit both into the handle and charger.At $129 this is a terrific value. I don't think anyone could design a better drill.

        "reviewText": "I am not a long time user of the drill, but I can say I found the same issues as others almost right away.  I also bought the PC180DK-2 at Lowes for 99.99.I took the first drill I bought back the next day because of two issues that happened right away.1. The charger didn't seem to work right.  When I put a battery in the charger, I would go back after some time, and the charger would be giving me the rabid flash warning.  This happened with both batteries.  The charger was plugged into my wall outlet on my house, so there shouldn't have been an issue with dirty power like you get from generators and such.2.  I was using a half inch drill bit to drill through some six by six pillars on my porch to put a galvanized lag bolt through, and the internal gears stripped out.  I have never had this happen.  On my old 12 volt Ryobi drill, if it couldn't drill through something it would just stop, and you would let go of the trigger. Not strip out the gears!  Those gears stripped out quick, I had no warning!The irritating issue:The chuck will NOT hold onto a screw driver bit, nor a drill bit.  Very often when you stop the drill, it drops the bit.  I think it is because when you let go of the trigger, the drill brake stops instantly, but I am not sure.  That is very irritating.All in all, I wish I hadn't bought this one.  I took the first drill of this model back to Lowes because I thought I had gotten a lemon, but it seems this is a pretty well established issue with this drill.I just exchanged it because I had heard Porter Cable where good tools, but I didn't know that they were recently bought by Black and Decker, and the quality went down.I took this drill back once, I just feel bad about taking it back again.  I am dissapointed with it, but feel stuck with my bad decision.  I checked the reviews of this device on Amazon before I bought it, but there are better review on this device at lowes that describes the problem this drill has.There is also a 4th problem I have read about from multiple sources that the batteries pop out, after some lenght of time.  For an in depth review of someone who has used the device for some time, I would recommend the 3 star review on here from \"Woodmaster\".  For me, the issues I illistrate were apparant right away.With the second drill, I haven't seen that fast flash warning signal on either battery, and I will be very careful with it to not strip the gears.My old Ryobi 12 volt is much more rugged and built better.I give this 3 stars just because I don't have enough experience with it to honestly give it a lower rating.  However, the bits falling out is quite an irritating issue.To see for the issue of the drill bit popping out for yourself, go to youtube and type in \"the suburban hippie experimentalist\" and look for my review on this Porter Cable drill",

Ether the drill just doesn't have the power to get the job done or the battery dies.My last drill before I got this one had a descent amount of power to it but the battery would die after drilling 24 holes and setting 24 decking screws. Very frustrating when you are trying to get a job done.This drill however has a fantastic amount of power and can even drill through steel on its high gear setting in no time. But the drill is only a drill and doesn't come with a battery. I recommend the Robi P108 4AH battery. It's an $100+ battery but end the long run it is just fantastic. I have used that battery with my curricular saw and drill for hours and only run it halfway dead. And it gives this drill just a bit more UMPH! to get the job done.Easy guideline for seeing how long a battery will last is: If you double the batteries capacity (ie. 1.2AH to 2.4AH or  2.4AH to 4AH)  then you quadruple the life of the battery before for it gos dead! And the larger battery can put out more power at any time when it is needed, meaning less stress on the battery and a longer shelve life too.",

The drill bits were 1/4\" hex shank and even the Hitachi box shows a hex shank screwdriver bit in it's chuck on the front cover photo. But the smaller diameter bits of the Irwin 1/4\" hex shanks had some substantial wobble when used in the chuck of this Hitachi. I played around with the positioning, and eventually I diminished the wobble to a bare minimum. But I'm not happy about this. Summary: Irwin says that their 1/4 inch hex shanks work in any 3/8\" chuck; Hitachi...on the cover of the box...'show' a 1/4\" hex shank bit being utilized (actually, a screwdriver hex shank bit); and yet I get wobble in the smaller diameter hex shank bits.",

        "reviewText": "Its been a good run.  I purchased this drill about two years ago right when it came on the market.  On the shelf I was impressed with its weight and feel vs. the other drills I was comparing it with.  Once I got it home, I put it to pretty intensive use, over a hundred full charges, on jobs that would be much more suited for a 18V or larger drill.  From drilling holes in sheet metal for automotive use, mixing paint, construction framing, and remodeling two bathrooms and other projects around the house.  The amount of torque it produces for the weight is unmatched.My latest project finally killed it, hundreds of two inch un-countersunk hardi-board screws later.  These screws have a thicker diameter than framing screws and I was sinking them through 3/8ths hardiboard (similar to concrete).  This is the kind of job that takes a firm two handed grip, full body weight for leverage and causes a sweat after a couple screws.  Hard work, and the drill took that kind of abuse all the time.The gears are starting to strip now, and its progressively losing its ability to apply really high torque.  Consider keeping the drill off of \"drill\" setting when performing heavy duty tasks for increased life of the gears.  Minus a quarter of a star to Hitachi for using gears that aren't as strong as the stall torque of the motor.Another side note, at some point I bent the chuck, probably by using a long hole cutter through 6 inches of wood at awkward angles.  The drill continued to operate, but it made it harder to sink screws due to wobble, and pretty much ruined it for precision drilling.  Keep an eye on how much side loading you put on it.For a pro, or DIY person this is an ideal small drill, Its light weight and small dimensions make most jobs a snap.  Its not indestructible, so if you have really tough jobs, do yourself a favor and pickup a larger drill.  My plan is to buy another one of these and relegate it to smaller jobs, and pick up a cordless impact to take on the larger stuff.",

        "reviewText": "I got this drill elsewhere and paid more for it, but it came with the fast charger. There was a cheaper option w/out it but i thought waiting around for 3 hours from depletion to full was not a great idea during a project. Turns out, it is almost impossible to run this dry with medium-light use and occasional charging. I have many many power tools from gardening to power saws to sanders. THIS IS MY FAVORITE POWERTOOL IN MY POSSESSION BY A MILESTONE. I absolutely love this thing! If I had a need to replace or get a second one I'd definitely get this one, having had paid $80 for mine.Design and AgingThe best looking of all lithium drills. Their lithium line up is aesthetically appealing. The pistol area has more rubber than other B and D drills and I like the silver paint with finger notches. Trigger is easy to modulate and takes a short practice to get the LED light to light up w/out the drill running. The chuck is firm and wraps bits securely. However, after 4 months of heavy use and off and on light-moderate uses the chuck's silver paint developed some wear exposing a small ring of the black plastic surface underneath.  Other drills have the chuck black unpainted plastic for a reason, however, it's not something I mind having at all since the chuck still functions like new and still has the embossed grooves. No rubber has ripped and is all intact.PerformanceIt's light and it plows. Pair the clutch to the surface, use proper driving technique, and finesse will usher in naturally. Easy to manage upside down, sideways, and with other hand. The 2 speed transmission was used on a few occasions. I was putting screws into 3 layers- wood 4x2s, 4x4s, and sheetrock. Dropping it down to 1st kept the torque high/rpms low, and screw stripping to a minimum. The 1st/2nd slider sometimes sticks but blipping the trigger alleviates it. I think the 2-speed lets it keep up with the big boys.VS NiCad DrillsI had a Skil NiCad 12v from 5-7 years ago. This one is 1/3 smaller, 1/3 lighter, maneuverable, and a heck of a lot more powerful. The motor size is a lot smaller and so is the battery. Maneuverability is a key part of versatility, which is paramount in your 'go to drill.'Those who havent't gotten on the lithium ion band wagon will wish they had sooner. If i ever get another cordless power tool, I would overlook all NiCads and go for Lithiums; no matter the price difference. Dealing with the memory issues, the boggle down near the end of a charge, and the size and weight have put me off them for life. I'm going to go on a limb and say that I absolutely despise that drill for letting me down multiple times and costing more than what I paid for for this drill.VS Plugin DrillsI also have a Plugin Ryobi with a 11speed clutch, which i still use. If you want real torque/power, get a plug in...period. I used the Ryobi and the B and D to drill holes in concrete subfloor and through drywall with metal window frames underneath. The Ryobi seemed to get through tough spots may be just a tad faster, but I'd call it a tie since the rare visceral experience of using a plugin may have skewed my judgement. In my mind, the B and D can equal my plugin drill in the tasks i threw at it. Probably the two reasons why I would use the Plugin for drilling and the B and D for fastening is because I am too lazy to change from drill bit to philips, and I miss using the Plugin:-)When I hit a tough spot in drilling with the B and D, and I'd reach for the Plugin, I found that both would have issues getting through. So I would just angle the drill from one side then to the other side and that would work with getting through the hole with both of them. Sometimes, I guess, the Plugin got through more quickly, but it is almost immeasurable.VS Premium DrillsI've used the Dewalt 20v lithium ion 1.5 amp drill and impact driver before on a project on my property. The impact driver is so quick and powerful I'd say that I'd never screwed that fast before on a cordless. However,  the raw torque and lack of clutch adjustment penalizes precision.  From that, i'd wish B and D made an impact driver in lithium form. the Dewalt drill I did not use, but I did feel the Dewalt had more helft and weight than the B and D. I appreciated the lightness in the B and D, the Dewalt impact driver, and another Makita impact driver i used.Final ThoughtsAs of now replacement 20v batteries are $37 on amazon. Dewalt and Makita has them in the mid $60s. I plan on getting more B and D cordless products especially in gardening. Whether the tool or the battery croaks first, it's cost efficient to replace the battery or forgo the tool and have a spare battery. Dewalt does not make gardening equipment and the closest thing Makita makes is a leaf blower. I am a real DIYer, not a professional. And speaking as a DIYer, I'd have a headache unplugging and plugging in battery chargers for a Makita leaf blower, a Dewalt drill, a Homelite weed trimmer, a B and D hedge trimmer, a Milwaukee oscillating multitool, Bosh reciprocating saw, Greenworks pole saw, and Portacable circular saw. And this is not nearly all the brands and tool types out there. It would be too annoying for me to manage all these proprietary standards of battery mounts. I'm going to try one battery brand and one charger as my philosophy. The performance of this drill, as well as some other purchased corded B and D products, has vanquished my B and D stigmas. Given their balance of price and quality I will look to them for more corded and cordless tools.",

        "reviewText": "This drill is a real winner. I love the power of this drill. in fact, it is so powerful that I broke the Philips bit that came with it. I have yet to use even one battery til it was dead and I've been remodeling a trailer with it. Though I was told that it is not good to run the battery til it is dead. At 1st I figured the flashlight was just an extra, I didn't care about it my main need was the drill, but I've found that I use the flashlight more than I use the drill. Now, why I rated this 4 instead of 5... 1st, I don't like the fact that the bit it comes with is a 2 sided Phillips bit, I'd rather have a Phillips and a flat bit combo, its just more convenient. The belt hanger that comes with it is cumbersome and makes it hard to grab quickly when needed (I removed it on mine) and any bit you use that is round instead of hex you will have to really tighten the chuck to keep it from slipping. (a simple 10 seconds on a grinder to flatten one side of your bit works) plus the flashlight would be better if it has more preset angles, perhaps a screw to tighten it at any angle (like a T bevel) would be better. and lastly I think the flashlight would be 10 times better if it used led's instead of a normal flashlight bulb. But all in all these things are minor and easy to work around. I love the quick charger, the fact that it has 2 batteries, and the case (though it would be better if the case had one more section for the other battery as I don't like to keep the battery in the drill) I do love this drill combo, and since I got it on sale for $50 it makes it that much better. I don't think I'd have gotten it at the normal $75. oh and one more issue that I almost forgot...While it only takes about 30 minutes or so to charge a battery, and it takes a good 30 minutes of heavy use to wear a battery down, you cannot just swap out the battery and continue to work. The charger will not charge if the battery is warm. While this is a good safety feature, it is kind of annoying. If you had just 1 more battery (total of 3) this would completely eliminate this issue. (one in use, one cooling down and one charging)",

A new set of 2 batteries was roughly $95 so at that point I went looking for a new Drill.The new unit cost $139 and is 5 times the performance of the old NiCad unit. Batteries last 3 or 4 times longer, do not lose charge as quickly in storage and recharge quickly.Highly recommended for anyone facing battery replacement on a drill motor more than a few years old. The only downside is that it did not come with a hardsided case like the old model.",

I was given an old NiCad 18 volt but the batteries were so terrible, I hated using it. This is my replacement for it!Pros:PERFECT size for home jobs. It's so much smaller and lighter than what I was used to, and can fit in smaller spaces more easily!!!TWO Lithium Ion batteries that seem to charge in a hurry!Light on the drill helps keep your target in sight, and you on targetComfy trigger and easy direction buttons (I'm changing on the fly with no hesitations or issues)Seems quieter to me than most other drills too, but I could be biased because of how much I like this one!Great battery life! I have had this drill for weeks and haven't even run down the first battery yet!Cons:The only thing I've thought of is that there's no groove or anything I've seen to store drill bits on the drill itself. Very minor.5 STARS!!!",

        "reviewText": "I have used Ryobi 14v and then 18v battery drills for years and presently have five various models of the 18v units. I'm a GC and the Ryobi drills have proven themselves to be a good value, strong, but large and heavy, with about a two year life span under heavy use. I recently had to install a set of exterior shop built screens on the second story of a Brooklyn Brownstone. As luck would have it, lightweight driver drills were recently reviewed in Fine Home Building magazine and the Dewalt received a very favorable review. As is typical, the reviewer based his opinion of the tools under test on the repetition of holes drilled and screws driven. While I was impressed by the review, with a shelf full of Ryobi's I wasn't moved to rush out and buy a new drill. While the reviewer's criteria was valid I would like to toss out another one.Installing the screens was a two day project due to the difficulty of access to the facade where they were to be installed. On day one I used one of my trusty old Ryobi 18v heavy weights. While not bad when standing on the shop floor, it was a definitely a hand full while hanging off of a ladder thirty feet in the air. That did it for me so at the end of the day off to the local big box to pick up a Dewalt DCD710S2. Fast forward to day two for an entirely different experience. Set up with a quick change bit receiver the DCD710S2 comfortably took its place hanging on my belt with the handy built in belt clip. Talk about a different experience. The short barrel of this drill meant that I could stay closer to the wall keeping my center of gravity over the ladder, a much more comfortable and safer stance. As I expected pre-drilling and driving the three inch screws was practically effortless for this lightweight and surprisingly powerful tool. While the screw count and hole size weren't important, the location of the installation was. This is where the Dewalt DCD710S2 really shines. It's a surprisingly powerful tool in a very comfortable to use package. I have yet to test battery life but I expect it to be reasonably good. I will update my review if I find it to be otherwise.This is a great tool in general but it really shines in tough access jobs where tool weight is a liability. I'm looking forward to using the drill in a more comfortable setting and can easily see it becoming my \"go to\" tool for driving screws and drilling reasonably sized holes. I also have a Dewalt 18v XRP to handle tougher drilling requirements, which will be covered in another review. These two tools have put me solidly in the Dewalt battery powered driver/drill camp. I highly recommend the Dewalt DCD710S2.Regards and Build Responsibly - Our planet depends on it !!HouseWhispererCT",

About 2 weeks ago I had a really big job to do installing dispensers in the new Army Reserve building at our base.  With about 100 dispensers to install, I needed a drill that could do a heck of a lot of work involving both drilling holes, and putting in screws.  Not only did this drill work flawlessly, it made the job far easier than would have been the case with my old Craftsman 14.4 volt cordless.  Through all of those installations my battery never seemed to run out of juice.  That definitely wouldn't have been the case with my old drill.  As small, ergonomic, and light as this drill is, it also didn't tire my arm holding it for hours on end.  I liked the drill so much that A few days ago I bought one for myself.  That is the final word on what I think of this product.  Had I any reservations about the quality of the drill I'd not have bought one for my own use.  For the average homeowner this product will do what you need around the house with more than enough power, and with good enough battery life that you won't be swapping out the battery every hour or two.  Get one for yourself; you  won't be disappointed.",

So let me reassure anyone who is a bit nervous about buying a smaller tool: this drill performs just like the big guys. Sure, it's a little less powerful, but its incredible lighness and agility more than make up for that. Everything that's great about the 14.4V and 18V drills is here: the otherworldly battery life, the fantastic ergonomics, the way it keeps 99% of its power until the battery is 99% dead, the the excellent torque adjustments and two-speed gearbox. It's too early to say anything about the durability, but the build quality feels like nothing less than the standard set by the bigger DeWalt tools.",

I was fixing up a hinge on a cabinet door and needed to make the original hole a little bit bigger to support a stronger bolt. As I was using the drill bit to increase the size of the hole it broke in half and the drill bit got stuck inside of the hole (thankfully I was able to get it out). This was on wood no less and I was pushing quite hard with it barely even making a dent. To be honest, I'm having better luck using a screw driver by hand than using this.

I have drilled some big holes and it just seemed to have more power than I ever expected.  I have just completed a pergola project on our back deck and it almost went the whole way before I had to recharge it and even then it had enough power left for average jobs.  This included using it as a power driver to put in near five inch screws.  My only concern about this is that I am not really sure if the battery can be replaced.  Dollar for dollar, this is one of the best buys I have made in tools.  I absolutely would recommend this little powerhouse.",

        "reviewText": "I loved this drill when I first got it, so I'm going to chalk up my problem to it being a one-off issue (see \"Experience\" section).Pros:1. Awesome ergonomics. I just wanted to hold my new drill because it feels great to hold. I caught my friends picking up my drill to feel it in their hand.2. Light weight. It's incredible how much torque such a small piece of equipment can generate.3. Sturdy ratcheting chuck. The chuck feels solid - way more solid than any of the other compact drills I have examined. I didn't experience any discernible wobble problems.4. Batteries charge fast (less than 30 min.) and have a long run-time.5. LED light helps illuminate target surface from a distance.* (I didn't realize how useful this feature would be. Added bonus.)Cons:1. * LED suffers from shadow cast by the chuck when up close to target surface.2. Weak manual on one sheet of paper.  They could definitely improve upon that with a booklet and a larger font.Experience:I was in the middle of installing a closet system in my master bedroom.  Toward the end of the project, I was driving screws into MDF shelving when I pulled the trigger and the drill started clicking but not really spinning.  I also started to smell something burning, so looked at the motor part of the drill and pulled the trigger.  I will admit that I wasn't wearing goggles (bad), and something small (speck-sized) hit me in the eye.  I was able to get the drill spinning again after pulling the trigger a couple  more times, but the same thing happened again.  The drill also developed a very subtle clicking sound from that point.  Luckily I was literally on my last screw, so I was able to finish the project.  I returned the drill not sure if I wanted to give Dewalt another shot.  In the end, I just really liked the drill and want it to work out, so I ordered the drill and impact driver combo kit to replace it.  If I have anything productive to add to this review after receiving the new set, I will update it.Some people are partial to Dewalt.  Some people seem to complain that Dewalt tools are just over-priced Porter Cable tools.  I'm too ignorant of the power tool industry to have an opinion on that.  I'm just a new home-owner that has lots of fixing up to be done. (Ever see \"The Money Pit\"?)  I just want a drill that is light, comfortable, and powerful, and I want the batteries to last.  I looked at all reputable brands and chose this one because of the size, weight, solid chuck and long lasting batteries.I'm rating the drill 3 stars due to my defective experience. I hope to raise that to 5 stars if my new drill pans out.  I really hope this was a one-off incident.  I'm also hoping that I don't get the dreaded \"wobbly chuck\" problem that others have mentioned with the new drill...UPDATE (2/23/12):I received a clearly used combo kit in the mail.  It had been resealed and the case was fairly scratched up. Best of all <sarcasm>, the impact driver smelled like it was burning. I also decided to check out the chuck to see if there was the reported wobble, and yes, there was a definite wobble. (Please see the attached video.  The bit in the drill spins straight in several other drills.  I was doing some hex driving and felt I needed to document it.  Sorry for the shadows.  I have other videos of the chuck itself wobbling, but they are less clear.)Shipping me a used and defective product was Amazon's fault.  There is no way this kit should have been sent back out.  I have already ordered a replacement, but I'm starting to really wonder about Dewalt's quality after checking out the wobble on the drill's chuck. I'm not going to change my 3 star rating yet, but if this one comes back with the same chuck wobble or any burning issues, I will...and I'll be changing brands.  Stay tuned...FINAL UPDATE (3/6/2012):My last combo set arrived.  This one appeared to be new (no scratches on case and it was not re-sealed).  Both the drill and the impact driver smelled like they were burning. Maybe this is how they're supposed to smell, but if that's the case then Dewalt needs to at least be consistent. The fact that my first and second drill did not (at least initially) smell like they were burning, but the third one did indicates manufacturing problems to me.  That being said, my major problem is not with the smell.The third drill exhibited the same noticeable wobble as the second drill. I am now very disappointed with Dewalt for allowing this product to make it into production with this issue.  When I'm spending this much money on something, I expect quality.  I love the ergonomics and features of this drill, so I'm giving it 2 stars for potential.  Until Dewalt gets its act together and fixes the chuck wobble, I recommend looking elsewhere.Side note: It seems that chuck wobble is reported in reviews of most, if not all, \"high-end\" compact drills that I have looked at, so maybe there is a problem getting a true chuck in such a small body.",

I was a little unsure about the light but I must say it is a great addition.

During assembly of several face frames using this tool with a Kreg jig, the drill started overtightening and stripping the screws.  At the time of failure, the clutch was set at 10 and I had already tightened about 20 screws with no problems.  Oh well, I'll go back to snugging the screws with the driver and hand tightening the rest of the way.  I just thought I would see if this drill had a more dependable clutch than past drills.  It doesn't.  If it lasts, I'll still consider this a good purchase.",

I was simply going to buy a couple of new batteries until I saw the price, two new batteries were very close to the price of a new drill.If I was going to buy a new drill, I decided it would have Li-Ion batteries because my experience with them in general is vastly superior to NiCad batteries.After comparing a few options, I had pretty much settled on this model, and was going to order it from Amazon, but then a need arose for getting one immediately. Fortunately for me, Home Depot had the same thing at the same price, so I ended up buying it there.The only small disappointment was that one of the photos on Amazon is misleading - it shows a screw bit holder attached to the base.The kit doesn't actually have that, it only has the HOLDER for it -- just the clip on the base of the drill - that is what the documentation refers to as the bit holder.Compared to my old Makita, its smaller, definitely lighter (thanks to the Li-Ion battery) and charges faster.It also has the ability to lock the chuck so that accidentally operating the trigger doesn't have any unpleasant side effects - nice touch.I consider this money well spent.",

When the charger died I decided to go ahead and shell out extra $ and go for the new 20 volt Dewalt, despite ll the sales on the 18 volt version. When it arrived I was still feeling a bit guilty about the expense, but when I opened the box and saw it, picked it up and used it I was in love. This drill/driver is worth every penny and Dewalt has added some features that make this the go to tool. Beautifully balanced and light, small enough to get into tight places, hook for the tool belt.

Being female and having a husband who's not into projects, I had to seek out a way to test drive the Dewalt DCD780C2 20V before reviewing it.My Test: Dismantling a 10 year old wooden playset.I had tried to do it before with manual tools, but quickly gave up as it was just too daunting. Next I purchased a wimpy\u00a0Black & Decker GCO14SFB 14-Volt Ni-Cad 3/8-Inch Cordless Drill/Driver with Storage Bag and Stud Sensor\u00a0package.  I liked the BD product for quick in-house projects, but the battery life was so-so and definitely under-powered for bigger jobs like the playset dismantle.Enter the DEWALT.  Obviously up to the task in power with the 20V, it arrived charged and ready to go, with a charger and an extra battery (also charged when I opened the box). For what amounted to probably 40 bolts and screws being removed, this thing powered through without a hic-up and power to spare on the first battery.  I was mightily impressed as this is my first professional grade power tool, and I can now see why individuals who do big projects and/or are consistently doing DIY projects, would invest the money in buying this product. Bottom line:  It's great!While I didn't need it for my project, the LED light is a very cool feature. Ergonomically speaking... it fits great in my small hands.  The case is not super heavy-duty, but it gets the job done.  I like that it holds both (1.5 Ah lithium-ion) batteries, the A/C charger (compatible with the 12V max and 20V, is dual compatible) and the compact (7.5\") drill/driver. NOTE: 3.0 Ah lithium ion batteries will also work with this drill/driver - sold separately.For a woman who lifts heavy weights in the gym 4x's a week, this tool was still what I would consider to be 'heavy' for overhead work.  I think most users of this tool would not see that 3.5 pounds as a big deal, but not having much to compare it too, it seemed heavy to me after an hour or so of work.The drill comes with a standard 3 year warranty, 1 year free service contract and a 90-day money back guarantee. The 1.5 Ah lithium ion batteries come with a 2 year free service guarantee.The 5-star rating is well deserved for this tool and its packaging. This is a fantastic drill at a fair price.  It would be an excellent quality 'go to' tool for plumbers, installers of various types, remodelers, woodworkers, and other professionals or hardcore hobbyist, DIY'ers.",

        "reviewText": "It's immediately apparent when you first use this drill that it is way more powerful than the drills a casual user might pick up for common household chores. This can handle big projects, and the battery lasts a very long time. I'm not expert on these kinds of things - I had to ask a neighbor what to do about getting drill bits for this to use, but that ended up being simple enough. I also really like the light that automatically turns on during use and off when idle. It's a nice touch that shows how much attention they paid to what users really need.If all you do is put together the occasional shelf from Ikea, you probably don't need something this strong. But if you've got larger projects, especially outdoor stuff, where using a drill with a cord can be a hassle, I think this Dewalt drill is a great choice.",

We beat the heck out of this thing over the last year and it looks it, but it operates like it just came out of the box.  That's what one would expect, right?  It has one function and it should do that one thing very well for many years.  Hopefully we get to the \"many years\", but so far, it's been great and worth every penny.",

When I first started my job I invested in this DeWalt drill since EVERYONE has one.  After using it for a while I feel that it is not all that it is hopped up to be, the battery life sucks and I had to replace the battery after a couple months because it stopped holding its charge.  After trying out others I would recommend Makita for the price and performance, also do stay away from Ryobi that brand of power tools is a joke (I would get it for my learning teen but not for professional use).",

The drill is very simple to use, but if you are more visual and don't want to to read instructions - this is a quick way to see what it does, and how to use it. In my opinion the video is more useful for woman like me, who want to feel more comfortable using a drill for the first time (I remember using a screwdriver forever because I just wasn't so sure what kind of damage I can do with an electric tool).We bought it when we decided to build a loft and didn't want to use our cheap drill for such a big project. We use it all the time for quick fixes around the house. This drill is light and feels great in the hand. The speed control is very good too. And I never used to bother with speed controls on my drill before.Have fun with it!",

Many wrote that the chuck wobbled and I hesitated to buy it for this reason. I use this drill constantly in a retail store and have had \"zero\" problems with the chuck in that area. It runs true to center and stays tight. The chuck works strange in that it tightens well only when the trigger is not engaged at all. The brake holds the chuck at rest and, only then, will allow the bit or driver to grip snugly. Works well! Although Dewalt may have fixed the issue because most of the negative reviews are two to five years old. The batteries hold a charge well also. I have only charged them once in about two months time using the drill for about ten minutes or so at a time. This is a company drill and now I am going to get another one for my home use. Great product and I hope this review helps any of you out there who are undecided to make a wise choice.",

I have had other Hitachi tools and overall, this one keeps their reputation for delivering quality tools alive. I would recommend for everyone.Update: Now that I have had the combo for a while, I have to change my mind about the light. It is terrific. I use it so much more than I expected.

Man am I glad I did, I used the other drill maybe a half a dozen times in two years and went to go fire it up and the batteries will no longer hold a charge........This puppy has set for about three months since purchase and it tore my entire house apart for packing in a matter of minutes for each task. Whether it was breaking free tv mount bolts that have been in place for five+ years or bed frames that were assembled for 6+ years it was up to the task. Love the case and all it's unused little cubbies, great for storing nails, bolts, nuts, other batteries (non drill related) etc.",

At first I thought the belt/pocket attaching clip was kind of hokey, but when I need to free my right hand doing a task, the clip is indeed handy.  I was pleasantly surprised at the quality and usefulness of the work light that was included of the deal.  I have already used the light several times, and is much handier than a flashlight because it stands upright and the beam is adjustable up and down.  Battery life is VERY long.",

Worked great drilling into brick pillars and was a good complement to my other regular 18V Dewalt drill when drilling pilot holes in wood followed by driving in the masonry screws.  Adjustable handle was a plus when drilling into tight places.  Won't be using the hammer function as much as the regular drill function but it seems to spin faster than my standard drill which could be useful for sanding disks and wire brushing.",

Yes, they get a thorough work out in my Construction business, and yes, they are workhorses, but come on.  DeWalt wants $ 99.99 to replace the clutch and/or brushes at their factory service centers and they will only give you a 90 day warranty.  Doing the math, I find it cheaper in the long run to just buy a new one bare.  I am already so heavily invested in the DeWalt 18-Volt Ecosystem...OK...\"ecosystem\" isn't the correct word to use here, but that's how I feel...that I can't afford to look at other options at this particular point in time, but eventually, something has to give.

I've had it about 4 months now and it's been reliable, and the battery does a good job of retaining charge. It came with two batteries, and I'm still on the first charge of the first battery. I've hung some shelves, built a cedar closet, and various other tasks and it's still going strong. for my cedar closet, I was shooting 2 inch screws into 2x4 studs. I probably did 50 screws.

Nonetheless, I returned the product hassle free and had the right drill with the two batteries about a week later. Total time it took to receive the correct item from date of order was about 10 days. It's the best deal out there for this drill but if you're in a hurry for it, I wouldn't suggest you get it here. I do, however, highly recommend this drill. I've had it for about two months now and it works great. Very powerful for a drill this size and it keeps a charge even when you don't use it for a week or two. I was drilling 3\" screws through 2x4's with no problem at all.",

Drill has plenty of power to shear a screw, 22 clutch settings to prevent doing that. Long battery life even under high use commercial type application.  Drill trigger is very responsive and easy to feather.  Battery charger is the UC18YG universal 7.2-18v. Battery charges in 30-45 minutes, about the time in use battery under heavy load runs out, so you can keep swapping and working.  I bought the 12v version to replace an older 9.6v Hitachi drill that has been in constant use for many years, the batteries have grown tired. The 9.6v batteries can be used in the 12v, the 12v cannot be used in the 9.6v.",

This hitachi is a great cordless drill for any homeowner,handyman, even a contractor will like this drill. contractors might not have all the power a 18-24v drill has but this hitachi is great quality and good power that cant be beat for the money. oh yeah one other thing i love about it is the size! small compact and not too heavy! great for tight spots. i would buy again!",

Right sized and powerful enough for most projects it is value priced and will provide several years of reliable service.  My batteries eventually gave out on my previous drill; otherwise it is still 100% serviceable.  Which brings me to a pet peeve; Hitachi and all other cordless tool manufactures please listen up!  It is more expensive to replace or rebuild the two battery packs than it is to buy the drill with it's two battery packs, charger, flashlight, bits, and the case!  Why is that?  Why be green and recycle when manufactures price this way?  It just does not make sense if you(manufactures) are even in the least bit environmentally responsible to support this type of pricing.  This is just another fine example of the throw it away and buy new, even when the old product is fully serviceable, mentality endorsed by most manufacturers.",

In college, I've had great experiences building large projects with borrowed Dewalt tools, and I was a firm believer in that brand.  But now that it's time to buy, I didn't think I could justify the incredibly high cost.So after doing some research on Consumer Reports and on here, I thought I'd give Hitachi a try.  The price, at $125 on Amazon, is $100 less than the 18v Dewalt, and I find it performs just as well for my purposes.  The construction is not heavy-duty, but it is far better and sturdier than the 12v Black & Decker, and it should be fine as long as you don't plan to drop it or run over it with a truck (I assume this can happen often at a construction site, but will not happen at my house, knock on wood).I am a new firm believer in Hitachi tools and will likely continue to build out my toolset with this brand.",

This drill is great for all that and since im only a DIYer i dont expect to put it or my saw through the kind of use a professional would so i think ill be alright with the battery life and parts wearing out. i also picked up the quick change drill bit and screw driver set and havent had a problem with the chuck as far as that goes.

        "reviewText": "I bought this drill based on the ergonomics.  I picked up and held every drill at the store and this one has perfect ergonomics.  The handle is very comfortable and it appears to be perfectly balanced, the weight is perfect, feels light but well made.  This drill is the most comfortable to hold by far of any drill I have seen or tested and I looked at every brand in several stores.The drill has a lot of torque and the clutch is great.  I use it as a cordless screwdriver most of the time and a drill on occasion.  Most chuck less drills have a hard time holding the bits, but you can use the DeWalt drill bits that have a hexagonal base and it solves the problem completely.The batteries last a long time and charge in about 30 minutes.  It comes with two so you can charge one while using the other.  They won't charge until they cool down however (the charger will not charge a hot battery).If you need a longer run time, you can get NiMH or Li-Ion batteries in anywhere from 1.5Ah to 3.0Ah that fit this drill.  If you go with either of those however, you will need a new charger since the supplied charger is only for Ni-Cad batteries.  The UC18YRL is a universal charger that can charge all 3 types of batteries.You can also buy the DS18DFL package which appears to be the same drill with Li-Ion batteries but without a flashlight.  For some reason the Li-Ion drill is rated about 6% less torque of 374in/lbs vs this one is 400 in/lbs, although I doubt anyone could tell the difference.The flashlight is bright and lasts a long time, I use it all the time.  The light comes with a spare lamp inside if you unscrew the cover.  I had a hard time finding replacement lamps for the light for a while, but then found out the Makita ML180 lamps work perfectly as a replacement so I just pick those up at a local Makita dealer.I have dropped both the flashlight and the drill onto a concrete floor about several times and both survived without damage except killing the flashlight bulb if the light was on.I bought two kits I use in two locations and this set has been great in every way.  The batteries are getting old so I'll replace them with NiMH or Li-Ion and get the universal charger.All rechargeable batteries self discharge so if you charge it and store it, it will be dead when you need it.  If you use it only occasionally, it is best to store the batteries with a low charge or near empty, not fully charged to extend their lifetime.When you replace them, you can recycle them at most hardware stores or any Radioshack will accept them.  Don't throw them out, the Cadmium is toxic and like all rechargeable batteries, they should be disposed of properly.",

I'm the Maintenance Supervisor of the multi-use building where I work so I have used this drill on dozens of occasions for a variety of purposes.This drill is very comfortable to use and is relable in its' performance. The battery life is usually sufficient to get the job completed, but on a more lengthy task which may require changing batteries they charge quickly enough that I always have a fully charged battery ready for use.When I first got the drill I did have a slight problem with the bits coming loose but that was mostly caused by my not adequately tightening the chuck. That's not an uncommon problem with keyless chucks, I've experienced that with other drills.The only negative comment I might have would be more of a personal feeling than a comment about this tools performance. I just don't feel this drill has the power to tackle a real tough job, such as drilling  through metal or sheet steel more than about 1/16\"; I use my heavier duty drill for those real tough projects. That one is also a Hitachi product and I believe their top of the line drill powered with Lithium Ion batteries, however it is a rather expensive tool.Overall, this a great little drill. I have no qualms in giving it a 5 Star recommendtaion for anyone looking for a dependable drill at a reasonable price for use around the home, in the home workshop or even on the job site.[...]",

We were not able to finish a 12 shelf bookcase with a fully charged battery. We plugged it in the charger and left it for the night to charge. The next morning we went to use the drill, and it was completely dead. My husband tried to remove the battery, but it wouldn't budge. He's in his mid 30's and in great condition. We had to pry the battery off with tools, and when if finally came off we found that it was covered in half dried battery acid. We returned it to the store, and exchanged it for the new one thinking this was a fluke. We charged it that day, and used it that night. We plugged it in again that night, and unplugged it that morning. A couple of weeks went by, and we had to use the drill again. The drill was dead. We plugged it in and let it charge for 4 hrs. By then we thought we would battery would have enough juice to screw in a couple of screws. It was still dead. We ended up exchanging it for this drill\u00a0Black & Decker SS12C 12-Volt Cordless Drill/Driverl. It's a huge step up from this drill. There are so many other options with it.

It worked great to put up curtain rods, put together modular furniture, and anything else I asked of it. Drilling into studs was not always easily done with this drill, but a pre-drilled hole easily took care of that problem.If i have to provide a critique, the drill is a little heavy for a 12v and kind of awkward in it's size. It does not easily fit into small spaces.For the money, this is all the drill you'll probably need if you are buying a 12v.

        "reviewText": "+++ THE PROS +++[+ UTILIZES LI-ION TECH]: Li-Ion offers more power in a smaller/lighter package, vs. NiCad and NiMH.[+ LED GUIDE LIGHT]: Positioned above the trigger. Turns on when you pull the trigger and auto-off after 20-seconds of non-use[+ 2-SPEED MOTOR]: High speed (up to 2,000rpm) for drilling, Low/Variable speed (up to 600rpm) with clutch for driving[+ LIGHT WEIGHT]: The 1.5A batteries weigh 12oz each. With battery inserted the total drill weight is 3.5lbs[+ 2 X 1.5A BATTERIES]: With each 1.5A battery capable of providing several hours of runtime, you're not actually giving up much runtime at all to have a lighter drill (vs. having a single 3.0A battery). That, in combination with the quick-charger being able to charge a battery faster than it takes to drain one...You could actually keep working with the drill on-stop, perpetually.[+ DUAL VOLTAGE QUICK CHARGER]: Charges a battery in 30min and if you happen to also use Dewalts' 12V MAX line, this charger will charge those batteries as well.[+ INCLUDES HEAVY-DUTY CARRY CASE]: With the included belt-clip, the drill could just as easily be a part of your tool belt or be in your tool box/chest. But if you like having a place for everything and everything in its' place, then the included case keeps your 20v kit together nicely and should be strong enough for the job site--- THE CONS ---[ - ACTUALLY 18V SYSTEM]: At full charge and checked with no load, you get the 20V reading. The actual in-use voltage is 18V. But so as to not confuse this new line with their other 18V lines that don't use Li-Ion, Dewalt calls these the 20V \"MAX\" system. So you'll need to remove the voltage difference, when doing comparison shopping, to other 18V systems.*** FINAL THOUGHTS ***I've got big hands (XL size gloves) and find this drill to be comfortable to hold, well balanced and even only after a short time of use the lighter weight is appreciated. The included instructions warn that using the variable speed of the drill can shorten the life of the motor, so it's especially nice having a clutch so you can just run the motor full tilt all the time and have the clutch kick-in at the right amount of tightness/torque you want.This is a new product line, based on the long time success of the 18V line and brought up to current technology and ergonomics. Well recommended.",

When this drill arrived at my home, we opened the box and just stood in silence for a few minutes.I've been happily using my Black & Decker Power Driver - with an occasional outing of my corded drill - for decades.  I've also been the family-handyperson for those decades, working with seriously underpowered tools, and severe hand arthritis.  Given these limitations, I was delighted to try the Dewalt Compact Drill/Driver.The Dewalt comes in a molded, hinged case, with both batteries charged and ready to use. The case has a small hole for a quick zip-tie lock, or you could pad-lock the handle.  The case is well-balanced for carrying, and is fairly compact.The Drill is well-balanced to hold and use (remember, this is coming from someone with arthritic hands, so I'm a harsh judge of poorly designed tools). An LED light comes on whenever the power is activated.  It's easy to change bits, and easy to use the drill on slow or high speed, forward or reverse - flips with the usual switch, which also locks the drill.  My first project was drilling drainage holes in the bottom of five 5-gallon buckets for growing potatoes. My friend used it to complete installation of a door latch in the garage.All of the parts work smoothly, with nicely engineered clicks, and clear yellow/black markings on the drill. It's easy to see how the battery fits on the base or the charger. Everything is good-sized; no itty-bitty switches, markings, or dials. There's a clip on the drill for hanging from your belt, or on a tool wall.It's my first Dewalt tool, and I'm impressed.  Won't be my last.  Perfect tool for the advanced handyman, contractor, or a woman who needs a real drill. I'm retiring my beloved B & D power driver!",

        "reviewText": "18 month update:Performing excellently. Batteries hold their charge even after months of shelf-sitting.First, the disclaimers:(1) My needs for power tools are relatively modest. While I have a house, my do-it-yourself endeavors are not extensive due to shortfalls in my own time, tools and talent (depending on the project).(2) With my limitations as a handyman acknowledged: I can and do take on those projects in my DIY wheelhouse. Many of these rely on what is unquestionably the first power tool purchase most people will ever make: a drill.(3) It's been at least five years since we had a working battery powered drill in the house. Most will be familiar with the reasons why: rapidly depleted batteries, long charging time and limited power when the going gets tough. For these reasons, I had been using a corded drill exclusively for a long time.(4) The real test of a tool like this comes over time. Two years ago I broke the cord on a Black and Decker drill that I'd owned since the 70s. While demanding decades of use probably unrealistic, the real test of this drill will come in five to ten years, when I can see if it still works (and at this price: the answer better be \"yes\").When this drill arrived, I did not have a significant project to test it on. The following is based on a series of tests using different bit sizes, drilling a variety of hardwood, softwood and metal samples, and screwing/unscrewing a variety of screw types in multiple locations.How does this drill get to five stars?Pros:-Rapid battery charging. Upon arrival, each of the two battery packs had sufficient charge to power the drill for drilling and screwing. While I was not able to fully deplete them, I powered the drill through a series of drilling/screwing tests using each. Time to return to fully charged was about 20m minutes, which I expect to be more than adequate to keep the drill running on the other battery back even in high load situations.-Excellent balance and feel. This drill stands firmly upright on the battery pack. It's weight is well distributed and its easy to maneuver to get at work that may not be directly in front of you. Start and stopping are as gradual --or as instantaneous-- as you'd like when you depress the variable-speed trigger.-Two speed transmission, 15 torque settings and forward/reverse are available to get the right power level and direction of spin to your job.--The case holds the drill, battery packs and charger unit.-Thoughtful extras:--The integrated LED light adds the extra illumination you always seem to need (no matter how well-lit you thought your workplace was)--The bitholder at the bottom stores bits parallel to the side of the battery. Having this there keeps them out of your pockets (and mouth!)Cons:I can only offer two minor gripes about this product. They in no way detract from its overall functionality, but you should be aware of them:-the latches on the case are made from extremely thin metal. While the edges are not razor sharp, they are surprisingly sharp, and the resulting feel is someplace between cheap and potentially dangerous (if you press really really hard!).-the included user guide is not printed in a booklet form, but instead on both sides of single sheet of paper. This guide is roughly the same size as the road maps we used to keep in the glove box in the days before GPS...and about as annoying to refold. Why DeWalt chose this instead of a booklet is anybody's guess, but its not convenient for reference and has a PITA factor in refolding.Assuming it stands up the challenge of long-term use in the hands of a not-so-skilled user: buy with confidence. There's plenty I don't know about tools, but know enough that going cheap means buying often...",

        "reviewText": "This is the drill I needed a month ago when I was taking apart a play set I had built for my son eight years ago!  Instead I purchased a Hitachi DS120DVF3 cordless drill which didn't have enough power for about 1/3 of the screws and I ended up dragging out my 100' extension cord and using my electric drill to finish the project.Needless to say this more expensive and more powerful drive works much better than that one. I just ran a side by side test and the DeWalt drill easily out-performed my cheaper Hitachi. The Li-Ion battery lasts much longer as well and the hand grip is actually smaller than the Hitachi which makes it easier for me to hold on to.  It does weigh a bit more than the Hitachi--but I can handle that.I know DeWALT is a quality name (my ex-husband always insisted on buying DeWalt when possible) and this one doesn't disappoint with the nice extra features like the belt clip, clip to hold a bit, and the built in light (which was a pleasant surprise)!  The two speeds and numerous clutch adjustments provides plenty of ways to adjust the power and speed.I also like how compact the case box is--it easily fits the drill, extra battery, and recharger, but the overall dimensions are small (4.5x10x15) which means it packs well and doesn't take up any extra space--whether that is on a shelf, or in a larger tool box.Bottom line: This is a nice top-of-the-line drill.  I feel like building something. . .",

        "reviewText": "Like many guys I've spent time doing construction. My first cordless drill was the original Makita, which lasted me through a couple of battery replacements. Since I'd gotten back to a desk and had lost the wrist strength to a use pro grade cordless, I replaced it with a\u00a0Black & Decker VPX1212X Li-Ion 14.4-Volt VPX Drill Driver, which is light enough to use and powerful enough to drive screws through 2x4s. For bigger jobs, though its batteries didn't last long enough and took too long to recharge.Enter the DeWALT. With its lithium ion batteries, it's light enough for me to use for hours. The batteries last for hours, too. I spent all day putting up a fence. The first battery got me through lunch and into the afternoon. I gave out before the second battery did about time to put some fish on the grill. It has plenty of power. It isn't an impact driver drill, which makes is slightly less powerful. On the plus side of that it has an adjustable clutch. When I get tired I rely on that a lot to not overdrive screws. It has two speeds. High is plenty fast enough to run a drill. Low has a variable speed, which is nice on delicate work. The handle is just right for my med-large glove size and can be used by those with smaller hands.The drill has all the little features I'd expect on a pro model. There's an LED light, a lanyard clip and a belt clip, as well as a clip to hold a screw bit. One nice touch is that the belt clip and screw bit holder are removable and can be switched for left handed users. It has a 1/2 inch chuck.I have a 25 year old DeWALT belt sander and a Porter Cable (same company) orbital sander that are both still going strong and have always considered DeWalt to make rugged and dependable tools. This has a 3 year limited warrante and a 1 year full one. As a home owner I expect this to last, though lithium ion batteries have a definite shelf life limit.",

        "reviewText": "This is a decent around-the-house cordless drill, but this is not a heavy-duty construction tool.The main reason I chose this drill is because I have some Black&Decker yard tools (a weed whacker and a blower) that use the same battery.  After years of use, the batteries are having trouble holding a charge.  So as long as I was in the market for a new cordless drill, I thought I'd give this one a try.  After all, the cost of the whole package is about the same as buying 2 new batteries (at least when I bought it on sale).  So the good part is that for the price of two new batteries, I essentially got a 3/8\" drill for free.As to the drill itself, however, you should be aware that this is a pretty basic unit.  It works fine for drilling the occasional hole, hanging a picture frame, doing the odd job around the house.  However, this is not a particularly heavy-duty piece of equipment.  It certainly would not be adequate for serious construction.  My old Kawasaki 19.2V is a much better drill, to say nothing of more serious brands.The bottom line:You get what you pay for.  As far as drills go, this is probably a low 3-star.  This isn't a Milwaukee or a DeWalt, so don't expect it to perform like one.  But if you can find this on sale, it is hard to argue with getting 2 battery packs plus a drill thrown in for less than $50.  For the weekend warrior who isn't looking to spend a lot, I bump it to 4 stars for the overall value proposition.",

It's such an odd feeling to be putting screws into boards and all of a sudden there's nothing and you you have to swap batteries.  The first time it happened I though the unit was broke but all you have to do is put the other battery in and away you go.

The drill is thoughtfully designed, comfortable to hold and operate, especially in small spaces. The drill comes with 2 Li-Ion batteries, which have plenty of capacity to get a project done. The external charger can recharge one battery while you are using the other.  The package includes a convenient carrying case for the drill, charger, and spare battery, with enough space to store a small set of drill bits. It includes a revfersible flat and phillips screw driver bit that stores on the magnetic stip on top of the drill. Initial tests show that the drill is powerful. The torque adjustment (silver band near the front) for screws works well. The design is a big improvement over larger drills with a big battery bulge at the bottom of the handle. The Porter-Cable PCL120DDC is a good drill at an excellent value.",

No more cranking on a ratchet forever, just zip bolts in and out super quick with this, and finish off to spec with the torque wrench. It's light and easy to use, and isn't so powerful that you snap bolts.Like all other B&D 20v lithium products, the battery on this is incredible. It has shelf life measured in years and charges in just a few hours, and you can go pretty much all day in all but the heaviest use. You might need a second battery if you're building a deck or drilling holes all day, but that's it.The interchangeable pieces allow you to have whichever type of drill motor you need at a much lower cost than buying a whole bag full of tools. I mostly use the impact, but when I have delicate work to do, I'll switch to the regular drill and set the clutch to a low setting.If you buy this, you're going to want hex socket adapters, because that's where it really shines. I hook up my impact-rated socket extensions and sockets and get right down into the deepest parts of my engine bay.The only downside to this is that the drill is slightly longer than it would otherwise need to be due to the matrix system. If you're looking to work in very tight spaces you may want to opt for separate drill and impact rather than the matrix kit. I also have the regular drill from before the matrix kit hit the market, and it's about 2\" shorter overall.Keep in mind that this is for light torque applications. If you're looking for one to zip off lug nuts all day, this isn't the one you want. It will remove some lug nuts but it can only really pull to about 80 lb-ft. I do use this on my lug bolts in conjunction with a breaker bar to break them loose to start and a torque wrench to torque them down properly.",

        "reviewText": "Last year I bought a B&D 20V weedeater / blower combo and just fell in love with these 20V lithium powered tools. The power is surprising for such light batteries.  I then bought a 20V pole saw and was really pleased with it as well. This tool came next.  I already had a cheapo 18V hammer drill that did OK.  This thing just blew it away.  4\" screws went right through a 2X4 into a 4X4 effortlessly sunk in! All the screws I used it for just drove it right in. no fighting or stripping the head out like with a regular drill driver. Make no mistake this tool is NOT not an impact wrench, so don't expect to turn lug nuts off your car with it.  But for screws and small bolts it's great.  The only thing I did not like about it is the double ended phillips / straight combo bit that came with it does not have an indent slot, so it won't snap in, it will fall out of the impact socket. I already have a boatload of indented bits and they all hold just fine.I also bought a regular 20V lithium drill which I got with a rapid charger and another battery - both I highly recommend getting, with a few extra batteries and the rapid charger, you will NEVER run out of power. I always keep this tools impact head in and never use the drill head, but I am sure it works great.I am going to buy a few more of the other Matrix heads, the oscillating saw looks interesting,  I am sure they will work just a well.",

Since the company was bought out many years ago all quality has disappeared. I had stopped buying B&D years ago after several tools failed within the first or second use, same story with their appliances. But my need for this drill is very light use so I decide to take the gamble, lost. second time on the charger the led will only blink red, indicating a bad battery! I tried to contact the seller only to discover that is impossible, the only option is to return the product, wait a few days after it gets there for a refund then buy another and wait a few more days to get that one delivered. This time that I spend is costing me more than the drill. I thought I could contact the seller and get the battery replaced and return the bad one when the new  one arrived, all actions are click a box and that option does not exist. Big waste of time",

While shouldn't expect a great deal of power from what is essentially a 1/4 inch drill, I need to set the driving power near maximum to drive in an #8 - 1 inch screw.In fairness, I was looking for a 1/4 inch drill for small work and that is exactly what this is. My perception of the lack of power is probably because I'm accustomed to using a 3/8 or 1/2 inch drill for everything.I gave the drill/driver a \"4 star\" rating instead of a 5 only because of my perception and had nothing to do with the drill/driver's performance. Probably undeserved, but perception is reality.",

        "reviewText": "I spent a lot of time researching a light-weight drill to use for my small duty tasks and projects.  The Hitachi 12v fit the bill perfectly.  I teach school and have my summers off. I've put a lot of time and money over the last four summers into an addition, a new kitchen, and a new bathroom that I've done most of by myself.  I've been using my 18v Makita for everything and it has never failed, but I have always cursed the thing when working in tight quarters or above my head for long periods of time (ceiling fans and drywalling ceilings).  I finally decided that a lighter drill was necessary and I debated over getting a big cordless screwdriver (Dewalt, Ridgid, Bosch \"Pocket Driver\")or a small drill.  After comparing many brands, I found the Hitachi to be the most powerful drill for its' size and price: 230lbs torque and 3.5lbs in weight.  It is also nice to have a chuck and not a hex head.  At $80 it's hard to beat, and it comes with a flashlight.  The Dewalt (80lb torque) and Ridgid (100lb torque) screwdrivers are the most powerful, but their weight is the same as the Hitachi 12v drill.  The super-light Bosch was very tempting but I was afraid that it would be underpowered.  I know that cordless screwdrivers and 12v drills are not the same, but seriously consider your needs and power requirements and you might just find as I did: this drill is the perfect tool to bridge cordless screwdrivers and drills (run-on sentence).",

        "reviewText": "I have two of these drills now. The first was originally purchased for use at my lake home. I also had a Dewalt 14.4 that I lugged back and forth, just in case I needed to do anything heavier duty.It turns out, this little drill can go head to head with that Dewalt, and now I much prefer it over the bigger and heavier Dewalt. (The Dewalt was 3 or 4 times more expensive originally as well).What surprises me about the Hitachi is the torque it has. Its fortunate that it has such a good adjustable clutch because this little thing has the power to twist off screw heads if you're not careful. Amazing for such a light and handy drill.The trigger has a great feel to it as well. One can feather it on and off to screw in something delicate and it responds exactly as you would expect. It doesn't keep spinning like the Dewalt tends to.I ended up buying the second drill for home here, and leaving the Dewalt up at the cabin \"just in case\". The Hitachi is the first one I reach for now.If Hitachi is listening, my only disappointment in this drill is the lack of two bit holders. The Dewalt gives me storage for a flat bit, a phillips and a square drive. With the Hitachi, I've had to leave the flat bit in the shop. Also, the bit holder that is there isn't very reliable. If you drop the drill, you better check the ground and make sure your second bit isn't laying there. But this isn't a show stopper.Also, the magnetic bit holder included with the kit remains in the shop as well. If you use something like this primarily wandering around outside your shop (as I do up at the lake), you'll almost certainly want a quick change bit holder with a more positive action to it (Dewalt's are VERY good). If you rely on the Hitachi bit holder, you'll lose bits. The bit holder plus a bit is also way too long to feel like you can get any leverage with it.I never use the flashlight, so can't really comment on it. I also don't use it all day every day, so can't really comment on battery life. It always seems to have enough juice when I need it. If not, the battery is quick to change, and doesn't \"stick\" like the Dewalt tends to do.All in all, I would definitely recommend this drill. I think it is one of the best bargains for the price. I have a Hitachi reciprocating saw as well that I really like, and will give Hitachi a shot for my other tools as they wear out and need replacing.",

With the DeWalt you put a battery in the charger and leave it until you need it.  Not with the Hitachi.  It says to take it out when charged.  Therefore you got to watch it.  Also, if you are using the drill alot and the battery gets low on power, it is also warm and the charger will not charge it until it cools off.  Can't get the battery to charge until it cools off????  If you need to charge right away, you are out of luck.I guess for the price, I can live with this flaw.
